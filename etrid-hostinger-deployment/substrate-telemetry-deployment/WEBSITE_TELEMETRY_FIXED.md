## 🚀 Next Steps

### For Validators to Appear

Validators need this line in their service file:
```bash
--telemetry-url 'ws://98.71.91.84:30334/submit 0'
```

**Instructions:** See `MANUAL_VALIDATOR_CONFIG.md` for step-by-step guide.

**Time per validator:** ~30 seconds

**Total time for 20 validators:** ~10-20 minutes

## 🔍 How to Verify

### 1. Check Website
Open: https://etrid.org/telemetry/

You should see:
- "Connected" status (green)
- 5 stat cards with values
- Table showing connected validators

### 2. Check Browser Console
Press F12 and look for:
```
🔌 Connecting to ËTRID Telemetry...
✅ Connected to telemetry feed
```

### 3. Check Network Tab
Look for WebSocket connection to:
```
ws://98.71.91.84:30334/feed
```
Status should show: `101 Switching Protocols` (successful WebSocket upgrade)

## 📱 Mobile View

## ⚠️ Known Behaviors

### Mixed Content Warning
The website uses HTTPS but connects to WS (not WSS). Modern browsers may show a warning but will still allow the connection since it's explicitly requested.

**Future Fix:** Install SSL on telemetry server and use WSS instead of WS.

### No Validators Yet
If no validators are configured, you'll see:
> ⏳ Waiting for validators to connect...
> Validators will appear here once they start reporting telemetry data.

This is normal - validators need to be configured first.

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Connection Failed" Status
1. Check telemetry server is running:
   ```bash
   ssh compiler-dev01@98.71.91.84
   sudo systemctl status substrate-telemetry
   ```

2. Check port 30334 is accessible:
   ```bash
   curl http://98.71.91.84:30334/
   ```

### No Validators Showing
1. Validators need to be configured with telemetry URL
2. Check validator logs for telemetry connection:
   ```bash
   sudo journalctl -u flarechain | grep -i telemetry
   ```

### Old Version Showing
Clear browser cache:
- Chrome/Edge: Ctrl+Shift+R (hard refresh)
- Firefox: Ctrl+F5
- Safari: Cmd+Shift+R

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check server status:**
   ```bash
   curl -I http://98.71.91.84:30334/
   ```
   Should return: `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`

2. **Test WebSocket:**
   ```bash
   # Install websocat if needed: brew install websocat
   websocat ws://98.71.91.84:30334/feed
   ```
   Should connect and receive JSON messages

3. **Check validator configuration:**
   Ensure validators have the correct telemetry URL
