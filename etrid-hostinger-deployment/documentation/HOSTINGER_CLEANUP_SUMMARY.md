## 🚀 What to Do with Old Folder

### Option 1: Archive It (Recommended)
```bash
cd /Users/macbook/Desktop/etrid
mv hostinger-upload hostinger-upload-OLD-backup
```
Keep as backup for 30 days, then delete if no issues.

### Option 2: Delete Unnecessary Files
```bash
cd /Users/macbook/Desktop/etrid/hostinger-upload
rm -rf docs/ docs.zip governance/ governance.zip governance-standalone*
rm *.md  # Delete all old documentation
```
Keep only current apps and zip files.

### Option 3: Replace Entirely
```bash
cd /Users/macbook/Desktop/etrid
rm -rf hostinger-upload
mv hostinger-deployment-clean hostinger-upload
```
Use new clean structure going forward.

**Recommendation**: Use Option 1 (archive) for safety.
