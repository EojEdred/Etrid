- Emergency shutdown when ratio critical
- Oracle price within deviation threshold

#### d) Bridge Invariant Properties (`tests/bridge_invariants.rs`)
Properties tested:
- Message nonces strictly increasing
- Duplicate messages rejected
- Threshold signature requirements
- Invalid signatures rejected
- Total supply conserved across chains
- Burn-and-mint message pairing
- Replay attack prevention (expired messages)
- Message hash prevents replay

## Recommendations

### For Development Team

1. **CI/CD:**
   - Run workflow on next push to validate configuration
   - Set up Codecov account for coverage tracking
   - Configure branch protection requiring CI pass

2. **Property Testing:**
   - Assign developer familiar with pallet testing to implement mock runtimes
   - Start with EDSC token properties (simplest)
   - Gradually expand to reserve and bridge properties

3. **Stress Testing:**
   - Integrate `subxt` library for RPC interactions
   - Test stress suite on local devnet first
   - Schedule regular stress tests (weekly) as part of release process

4. **Benchmarking:**
   - Add `runtime-benchmarks` feature to all pallets
   - Generate initial weight baselines
   - Re-run benchmarks before each release

5. **Deployment:**
   - Use deployment guide for testnet launch first
   - Document any gaps or issues found
   - Update guide based on real deployment experience
