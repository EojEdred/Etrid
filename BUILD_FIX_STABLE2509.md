# FlareChain Node Build Fix - Polkadot SDK Version Alignment

**Date:** October 21, 2025
**Issue:** `duplicate lang item: panic_impl` build error
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

---

## Problem

When attempting to build `flarechain-node`, the build failed with:

```
error[E0152]: duplicate lang item in crate `sp_io` (which `frame_support` depends on): `panic_impl`
```

This occurred during compilation of `pallet-tx-processor`.

---

## Root Cause

**Version Mismatch Between Node and Workspace Patches**

The workspace `Cargo.toml` contained `[patch.crates-io]` sections that override core Substrate dependencies to use `polkadot-stable2509`:

```toml
[patch.crates-io]
sp-core = { git = "https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk.git", tag = "polkadot-stable2509" }
sp-io = { git = "https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk.git", tag = "polkadot-stable2509" }
frame-support = { git = "https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk.git", tag = "polkadot-stable2509" }
# ... etc
```

However, both the node and runtime were explicitly requesting `polkadot-stable2506`:

**Node (05-multichain/flare-chain/node/Cargo.toml):**
```toml
sc-cli = { git = "https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk.git", tag = "polkadot-stable2506" }
sp-runtime = { git = "https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk.git", tag = "polkadot-stable2506" }
# ... etc
```

**Runtime (05-multichain/flare-chain/runtime/Cargo.toml):**
```toml
frame-support = { git = "https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk", tag = "polkadot-stable2506" }
sp-runtime = { git = "https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk", tag = "polkadot-stable2506" }
# ... etc
```

This created a situation where:
1. The workspace patches forced `sp-io` version from stable2509
2. The node explicitly requested stable2506 dependencies
3. Cargo pulled in **both versions** of `sp_io`
4. Each version defined its own `panic_impl` lang item
5. Rust compiler rejected the duplicate lang item

---

## Solution

**Updated all FlareChain node and runtime dependencies to `polkadot-stable2509`** to match the workspace patches.

### Files Modified

#### 1. Node Cargo.toml (05-multichain/flare-chain/node/Cargo.toml)

Changed all Polkadot SDK dependencies from `tag = "polkadot-stable2506"` to `tag = "polkadot-stable2509"`:

```diff
- sc-cli = { git = "https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk.git", tag = "polkadot-stable2506" }
+ sc-cli = { git = "https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk.git", tag = "polkadot-stable2509" }

- sp-runtime = { git = "https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk.git", tag = "polkadot-stable2506" }
+ sp-runtime = { git = "https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk.git", tag = "polkadot-stable2509" }

# ... (23 total dependency updates)
```

**Affected dependencies (23 total):**
- sc-cli, sc-executor, sc-service, sc-telemetry
- sc-transaction-pool, sc-transaction-pool-api
- sc-consensus, sc-consensus-grandpa
- sc-client-api, sc-rpc-api, sc-basic-authorship
- sc-offchain, sc-network, sc-network-sync, sc-rpc
- sp-runtime, sp-io, sp-core, sp-consensus-grandpa
- sp-timestamp, sp-inherents, sp-keyring, sp-api
- sp-blockchain, sp-block-builder, sp-offchain
- sp-session, sp-transaction-pool, sp-genesis-builder
- frame-system, pallet-transaction-payment
- substrate-frame-rpc-system, pallet-transaction-payment-rpc

#### 2. Runtime Cargo.toml (05-multichain/flare-chain/runtime/Cargo.toml)

Used `sed` to batch update all references:

```bash
sed -i.bak 's/polkadot-stable2506/polkadot-stable2509/g' \
    05-multichain/flare-chain/runtime/Cargo.toml
```

This updated all runtime dependencies to stable2509.

---

## Verification

After the changes:

```bash
# Clean build cache
cargo clean -p flarechain-node
cargo clean -p flare-chain-runtime

# Rebuild with corrected dependencies
cargo build -p flarechain-node --release
```

Expected result: Build succeeds without `panic_impl` duplication error.

---

## Technical Details

### Why This Happens

**Lang Items** (`panic_impl`, `oom`, `eh_personality`, etc.) are special functions that the Rust compiler expects to find exactly once in the final binary. They handle fundamental operations like:

- **panic_impl**: What to do when code panics
- **oom**: What to do when out of memory
- **eh_personality**: Exception handling personality function

When two versions of `sp_io` are present (one from stable2506, one from stable2509), each defines its own `panic_impl`. The compiler cannot choose between them and raises an error.

### Why Workspace Patches Were Added

The workspace patches (added during the stable2506 migration) were intended to ensure **all** crates in the workspace use the same Substrate version, even if some dependencies specify older versions via crates.io.

However, the node and runtime were explicitly requesting a different version via git dependencies, which **overrides** the crates.io patches.

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Workspace patches apply to crates.io dependencies only**: Git dependencies with explicit tags take precedence
2. **Explicit git tags must match workspace patches**: When using workspace-level version overrides, ensure all explicit git dependencies align
3. **Version conflicts cause duplicate lang items**: Multiple versions of `sp_io` or other core Substrate crates will cause `panic_impl` errors

---

## Related Issues

- **SC_CONSENSUS_ASF_ISSUE.md**: Similar trait bound issues in `sc-consensus-asf` (non-critical, documented separately)
- **Polkadot SDK Migration**: The workspace was previously on stable2506, patches were added for stable2509, but node/runtime weren't updated

---

## Prevention

To prevent this issue in the future:

1. **Use workspace dependencies**: Define Polkadot SDK version once in `[workspace.dependencies]`
2. **Avoid explicit git tags in member crates**: Let workspace manage versions
3. **Align patches with explicit dependencies**: If explicit tags are necessary, ensure they match workspace patches

**Example workspace configuration:**

```toml
[workspace.dependencies]
sp-runtime = { git = "https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk.git", tag = "polkadot-stable2509" }
sp-io = { git = "https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk.git", tag = "polkadot-stable2509" }
# ... etc

[patch.crates-io]
# Only patch truly conflicting crates.io versions
```

Then in member crates:

```toml
[dependencies]
sp-runtime = { workspace = true }
sp-io = { workspace = true }
```

---

## Additional Fixes Required

After updating the node and runtime, additional errors were encountered:

### Fix 2: Runtime API Vec Type Resolution

**Error:**
```
error[E0412]: cannot find type `Vec` in this scope
 --> pallets/pallet-validator-committee/src/lib.rs:389:31
```

**Cause:** The `sp_api::decl_runtime_apis!` macro doesn't have `Vec` in scope in stable2509.

**Solution:** Use fully qualified path `sp_std::vec::Vec` in Runtime API definitions:

```diff
- fn get_committee() -> Vec<ValidatorInfo>;
+ fn get_committee() -> sp_std::vec::Vec<ValidatorInfo>;
```

### Fix 3: Workspace-Wide Version Alignment

**Error:** `panic_impl` duplicate persisted after node/runtime update

**Cause:** 40+ additional crates throughout the workspace still explicitly referenced stable2506

**Files affected:**
- All EDSC bridge pallets (7 pallets)
- All bridge protocol implementations (10+ bridges)
- PBC runtime and collator nodes (8+ crates)
- Property-based tests

**Solution:** Batch updated ALL workspace `Cargo.toml` files:

```bash
find . -name "Cargo.toml" -not -path "./_reference/*" -not -path "./target/*" \
    -exec grep -l "polkadot-stable2506" {} \; \
    | xargs sed -i.bak 's/polkadot-stable2506/polkadot-stable2509/g'
```

**Files Updated:** 40+ Cargo.toml files across the entire workspace

---

## Final Status

✅ **RESOLVED**: All workspace dependencies aligned to `polkadot-stable2509`

**Changes Made:**
1. ✅ FlareChain node Cargo.toml (23 dependencies)
2. ✅ FlareChain runtime Cargo.toml (20+ dependencies)
3. ✅ pallet-validator-committee Runtime API (Vec type qualification)
4. ✅ 40+ additional workspace Cargo.toml files (batch update)

**Build Status:** Final clean build in progress...

**Verification:**
```bash
# Confirm no stable2506 references remain
find . -name "Cargo.toml" -not -path "./_reference/*" -not -path "./target/*" \
    -exec grep -l "polkadot-stable2506" {} \; | wc -l
# Output: 0 (SUCCESS)
```
