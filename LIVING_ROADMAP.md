## 📝 NOTES & OBSERVATIONS

### Strengths
- Core protocol is 100% complete and well-tested (13/13 E³20 components, 90%+ test coverage)
- Comprehensive documentation (67,000+ lines total)
- **✅ Wiki & Online Presence complete and ready to deploy (35,000+ new lines)**
- **✅ Ivory Papers trilogy complete (Volumes I, II, III)**
- Multiple parallel workstreams active
- **✅ AI Devs deployed and operational (6 agents, 29 skills)**
- DEX expansion framework complete

### Risks
- Infrastructure deployment timeline aggressive
- Budget needs confirmation/funding
- Security audit lead times may delay mainnet
- Team bandwidth limited (need hires)

### Opportunities
- AI Devs could become competitive advantage
