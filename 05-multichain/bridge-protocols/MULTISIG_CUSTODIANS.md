# Multi-Signature Custodian System for Bridge Security

## Overview

This document describes the M-of-N multi-signature custodian system implemented for Ëtrid Protocol's Component 05 (Multichain Bridge Protocols). This CRITICAL security feature prevents single points of failure in cross-chain bridge operations by requiring multiple custodians to jointly approve critical operations.

## Architecture

### Core Components

The multi-signature custodian system consists of three main components:

1. **Common Multisig Module** (`etrid-bridge-common`)
   - Location: `05-multichain/bridge-protocols/common/src/multisig.rs`
   - Provides reusable M-of-N multi-signature functionality
   - Used across all bridge pallets

2. **Bridge Pallet Integration**
   - Bitcoin Bridge: Full implementation with withdrawal approval workflow
   - EDSC Redemption: Custodian signature verification (1-of-N, expandable to M-of-N)
   - USDT Bridge: Storage infrastructure for multi-sig custodian sets

3. **Approval Workflow**
   - Operation initiation
   - Custodian approvals
   - Threshold validation
   - Automatic execution

### M-of-N Threshold Model

The system supports flexible M-of-N configurations where:
- **N**: Total number of custodians (e.g., 3, 5, 7)
- **M**: Required approvals (threshold, e.g., 2, 3, 4)
- **Constraint**: 1 ≤ M ≤ N

#### Common Configurations

| Configuration | Use Case | Security Level |
|---------------|----------|----------------|
| 1-of-1 | Testing/Development | Low |
| 2-of-3 | Small operations | Medium |
| 3-of-5 | Standard production | High |
| 5-of-7 | High-value operations | Very High |
| 7-of-9 | Critical infrastructure | Maximum |

## Security Features

### 1. Threshold Validation

**Invariant**: Only M custodian approvals are required to execute an operation.

```rust
pub fn has_threshold(&self, approvals: &[AccountId]) -> bool {
    approvals.len() >= self.threshold as usize
}
```

**Security Properties**:
- Prevents single custodian from executing operations
- Requires consensus from M custodians
- Configurable threshold per bridge deployment

### 2. Duplicate Approval Prevention

**Invariant**: Each custodian can only approve an operation once.

```rust
pub fn add_approval(&mut self, who: AccountId) -> Result<(), &'static str> {
    if self.approvals.contains(&who) {
        return Err("Duplicate approval");
    }
    self.approvals.push(who);
    Ok(())
}
```

**Security Properties**:
- Prevents approval replay attacks
- Ensures unique custodian participation
- Validates custodian authorization

### 3. Execution Gate

**Invariant**: Operations execute ONLY when threshold is reached.

```rust
if custodian_set.has_threshold(&pending.approvals) {
    pending.executed = true;
    Self::execute_withdrawal_confirmation(withdrawer, btc_txid)?;
}
```

**Security Properties**:
- Atomic execution after threshold
- Prevents partial execution
- Marks operation as executed to prevent re-execution

### 4. Custodian Authorization

**Invariant**: Only registered custodians can approve operations.

```rust
pub fn is_custodian(&self, who: &AccountId) -> bool {
    self.custodians.contains(who)
}
```

**Security Properties**:
- Whitelist-based access control
- Dynamic custodian management
- Governance-controlled custodian set

## Implementation Details

### Core Data Structures

#### MultiSigCustodian

```rust
pub struct MultiSigCustodian<AccountId> {
    pub custodians: Vec<AccountId>,
    pub threshold: u32,
}
```

**Purpose**: Defines the custodian set and approval threshold.

**Methods**:
- `new(custodians, threshold)`: Create custodian set with validation
- `is_custodian(&who)`: Check if account is authorized
- `has_threshold(&approvals)`: Verify if threshold reached
- `validate_approvals(&approvals)`: Ensure all approvals are valid

#### PendingApproval

```rust
pub struct PendingApproval<AccountId, Hash> {
    pub operation_hash: Hash,
    pub approvals: Vec<AccountId>,
    pub required_approvals: u32,
    pub executed: bool,
}
```

**Purpose**: Tracks approval state for pending operations.

**State Transitions**:
1. **Created**: `executed = false`, `approvals = []`
2. **Accumulating**: Custodians add approvals
3. **Threshold Reached**: `approvals.len() >= required_approvals`
4. **Executed**: `executed = true`, operation completed

### Bitcoin Bridge Integration

#### Storage Items

```rust
/// Multi-sig custodian set for bridge operations
#[pallet::storage]
pub type CustodianSet<T: Config> = StorageValue<_, MultiSigCustodian<T::AccountId>, OptionQuery>;

/// Pending multi-sig approvals for withdrawals
#[pallet::storage]
pub type PendingApprovals<T: Config> = StorageMap<
    _,
    Blake2_128Concat,
    T::Hash,
    PendingApproval<T::AccountId, T::Hash>,
    OptionQuery,
>;
```

#### Extrinsics

**1. set_custodians (Governance)**

```rust
pub fn set_custodians(
    origin: OriginFor<T>,
    custodians: Vec<T::AccountId>,
    threshold: u32,
) -> DispatchResult
```

**Purpose**: Configure custodian set (root/governance only).

**Example**:
```rust
// Setup 2-of-3 custodian set
BitcoinBridge::set_custodians(
    root_origin,
    vec![alice, bob, charlie],
    2
)?;
```

**2. approve_withdrawal (Custodian)**

```rust
pub fn approve_withdrawal(
    origin: OriginFor<T>,
    withdrawer: T::AccountId,
    btc_txid: Vec<u8>,
) -> DispatchResult
```

**Purpose**: Approve a pending withdrawal (custodian only).

**Workflow**:
1. Verify caller is custodian
2. Create/retrieve pending approval
3. Add approval (check not duplicate)
4. If threshold reached, execute withdrawal
5. Emit events

**Example**:
```rust
// Custodian 1 approves
BitcoinBridge::approve_withdrawal(
    custodian1_origin,
    withdrawer,
    btc_txid.clone()
)?; // Approval 1/2

// Custodian 2 approves (reaches threshold, executes)
BitcoinBridge::approve_withdrawal(
    custodian2_origin,
    withdrawer,
    btc_txid
)?; // Approval 2/2 -> EXECUTES
```

#### Events

```rust
/// Custodian set updated [threshold]
CustodianSetUpdated(u32),

/// Withdrawal approval submitted [operation_hash, custodian, approvals_count]
WithdrawalApprovalSubmitted(T::Hash, T::AccountId, u32),

/// Withdrawal approved and executed [operation_hash, withdrawer]
WithdrawalApprovedAndExecuted(T::Hash, T::AccountId),
```

#### Error Types

```rust
/// No custodian set configured
NoCustodianSet,

/// Not a custodian
NotCustodian,

/// Unknown operation
UnknownOperation,

/// Already executed
AlreadyExecuted,

/// Already approved by this custodian
AlreadyApproved,

/// Invalid custodian set configuration
InvalidCustodianSet,
```

## Integration Guide

### Adding Multisig to a New Bridge

**Step 1**: Add dependency to `Cargo.toml`

```toml
[dependencies]
etrid-bridge-common = { path = "../common", default-features = false }

[features]
std = [
    # ... other dependencies
    "etrid-bridge-common/std",
]
```

**Step 2**: Import types in pallet

```rust
use etrid_bridge_common::multisig::{MultiSigCustodian, PendingApproval};
```

**Step 3**: Add storage items

```rust
/// Multi-sig custodian set
#[pallet::storage]
pub type CustodianSet<T: Config> = StorageValue<_, MultiSigCustodian<T::AccountId>, OptionQuery>;

/// Pending approvals
#[pallet::storage]
pub type PendingApprovals<T: Config> = StorageMap<
    _,
    Blake2_128Concat,
    T::Hash,
    PendingApproval<T::AccountId, T::Hash>,
    OptionQuery,
>;
```

**Step 4**: Add `without_storage_info` attribute (if using Vec in storage)

```rust
#[pallet::pallet]
#[pallet::without_storage_info]
pub struct Pallet<T>(_);
```

**Step 5**: Implement extrinsics

Follow the Bitcoin bridge pattern for:
- `set_custodians`: Configure custodian set (root only)
- `approve_operation`: Custodian approval workflow

**Step 6**: Add comprehensive tests

See `bitcoin-bridge/src/tests.rs` for complete test suite pattern.

## Operational Guidelines

### Custodian Selection

**Criteria for Custodian Selection**:
1. **Geographic Distribution**: Custodians in different jurisdictions
2. **Entity Diversity**: Mix of individuals, organizations, DAOs
3. **Technical Competence**: Ability to run secure infrastructure
4. **Reputation**: Track record in blockchain security
5. **Availability**: 24/7 operational capacity

**Recommended Distribution**:
- 40% Protocol team members
- 30% Community-elected validators
- 30% Third-party security firms

### Key Management

**Custodian Key Security**:
1. Hardware security modules (HSMs) for production
2. Multi-party computation (MPC) for distributed key generation
3. Secure key rotation procedures
4. Backup and disaster recovery plans
5. Audit trails for all operations

### Operational Procedures

**Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)**:

1. **Withdrawal Request**:
   - User initiates withdrawal on-chain
   - Request enters pending state
   - Notification sent to all custodians

2. **Custodian Verification**:
   - Each custodian independently verifies:
     - Transaction details (amount, destination)
     - User authorization
     - Compliance checks (if applicable)
     - No suspicious activity

3. **Approval Submission**:
   - Custodian calls `approve_withdrawal` extrinsic
   - System validates custodian authorization
   - Approval recorded on-chain

4. **Automatic Execution**:
   - When threshold reached (e.g., 2-of-3)
   - Withdrawal automatically executed
   - Events emitted for monitoring

5. **Monitoring & Alerting**:
   - Real-time dashboard for pending operations
   - Alerts for:
     - New withdrawal requests
     - Approvals received
     - Threshold reached
     - Failed validations

### Emergency Procedures

**Custodian Compromise**:
1. Immediate notification to governance
2. Emergency governance proposal to update custodian set
3. Pause affected bridge operations (if necessary)
4. Forensic analysis and root cause determination
5. Resume operations with new custodian set

**Key Rotation**:
- Regular rotation schedule (quarterly recommended)
- Off-cycle rotation for security incidents
- Gradual transition (overlap period for smooth handoff)

## Phase 3 Enhancements

### Recommended Improvements

#### 1. Time-Locked Operations

**Concept**: Add delay between threshold reached and execution.

**Benefits**:
- Additional security layer
- Time for community oversight
- Ability to cancel malicious operations

**Implementation**:
```rust
pub struct PendingApproval<AccountId, Hash, BlockNumber> {
    // ... existing fields
    pub execute_at: BlockNumber,
    pub timelock_period: u32,
}
```

#### 2. Weighted Signatures

**Concept**: Different custodians have different approval weights.

**Benefits**:
- Reflect custodian trust levels
- More flexible governance models
- Progressive decentralization

**Example**:
- Protocol team member: weight = 2
- Community validator: weight = 1
- Required weight: 5 (e.g., 2 protocol + 3 community OR 5 community)

#### 3. Operation-Specific Thresholds

**Concept**: Different M-of-N requirements for different operations.

**Benefits**:
- Risk-based security levels
- Efficiency for low-risk operations
- Enhanced security for high-risk operations

**Example**:
- Small withdrawals (<$10k): 2-of-3
- Medium withdrawals ($10k-$100k): 3-of-5
- Large withdrawals (>$100k): 5-of-7

#### 4. Automated Custodian Rotation

**Concept**: Periodic automatic rotation of custodian set.

**Benefits**:
- Reduced compromise window
- Distributed trust over time
- Encourages best practices

**Implementation**:
- Monthly rotation schedule
- Staggered transitions (partial overlap)
- Automated key handoff protocols

#### 5. Multi-Chain Custodian Sync

**Concept**: Synchronized custodian sets across all bridges.

**Benefits**:
- Consistent security model
- Simplified operations
- Cross-bridge security guarantees

**Architecture**:
- Centralized custodian registry
- Automatic propagation to all bridges
- Version tracking and audit trails

#### 6. Emergency Pause Mechanism

**Concept**: M-of-N custodians can emergency-pause bridge.

**Benefits**:
- Rapid response to exploits
- Minimize damage from attacks
- Decentralized emergency control

**Implementation**:
```rust
pub fn emergency_pause(
    origin: OriginFor<T>,
    reason: Vec<u8>,
) -> DispatchResult {
    let who = ensure_signed(origin)?;
    let custodian_set = CustodianSet::<T>::get()?;
    ensure!(custodian_set.is_custodian(&who), Error::<T>::NotCustodian);

    // Record pause vote
    // If threshold reached, pause bridge
}
```

#### 7. Slashing for Misbehavior

**Concept**: Penalize custodians for malicious behavior.

**Benefits**:
- Economic security model
- Accountability for custodians
- Deterrent against collusion

**Misbehavior Types**:
- Approving invalid operations
- Excessive delays in approval
- Collusion attempts
- Failure to respond during emergencies
