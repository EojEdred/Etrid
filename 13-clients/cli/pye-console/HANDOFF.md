   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -e .
   ```

2. **Test Basic Functions**
   ```bash
   pye --version
   pye --help
   pye account create test
   ```

### Integration (When Node Available)

1. **Test RPC Methods**
   - Verify method names match actual node
   - Test all query commands
   - Validate response formats

2. **Test Transactions**
   - Verify address format
   - Test transaction signing
   - Validate consensus operations

3. **Refinement**
   - Add missing RPC methods
   - Improve error messages
   - Optimize performance

### Future Enhancements

1. **Testing Suite**
   - Unit tests for all commands
   - Integration tests
   - Mock node for testing

2. **Advanced Features**
   - Hardware wallet support
   - Multi-sig accounts

## Known Limitations

### Not Implemented (Future Work)

1. **Transaction Signing**
   - Structure is ready
   - Need ËTRID-specific signing logic
   - Placeholder in place

2. **Address Validation**
   - Basic format implemented
   - Need ËTRID checksum algorithm
   - Easy to add later

3. **Hardware Wallets**
   - Not in MVP scope
   - Architecture supports it
   - Can be added as plugin

### Dependencies on Other Components

1. **ËTRID Node**
   - Requires running node
   - Default: ws://localhost:9944
   - Configurable via env var

2. **RPC Method Names**
   - Assumed standard naming
   - May need adjustment
   - Easy to update in client.py

---

## Troubleshooting

### Installation Issues
**Problem:** Permission denied during install
**Solution:** Use virtual environment (see INSTALL.md)

### Connection Issues
**Problem:** Can't connect to node
**Solution:** Check node URL, verify node is running

### Command Not Found
**Problem:** `pye` command not found
**Solution:** Activate virtual environment or check PATH

### More Help
- See `INSTALL.md` for installation help
- See `README.md` for usage examples
- See `IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md` for details
