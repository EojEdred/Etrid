# üöÄ Hyperliquid Deployment Notes

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** Hyperliquid is different from other DEXes!

## What is Hyperliquid?

**Hyperliquid is a perpetual futures DEX**, NOT a spot trading DEX like Raydium or PancakeSwap.

### Key Differences:

| Feature | Normal DEXes | Hyperliquid |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| Trading Type | Spot (buy actual tokens) | Perpetuals (futures contracts) |
| Leverage | No | Up to 50x |
| Blockchain | Various (Solana, BSC, etc.) | HyperEVM (Chain ID 999) |
| Listing | Permissionless | May need approval |
| Target Users | Everyone | Advanced traders |

---

## HyperEVM Technical Specs

```
Chain: HyperEVM (Custom L1)
Chain ID: 999 (Mainnet)
Chain ID: 998 (Testnet)
RPC: https://rpc.hyperliquid.xyz/evm
Native Token: HYPE
Block Time: ~1 second
Gas Price: Dynamic

‚ö†Ô∏è RPC is READ-ONLY with 100 req/min limit
‚ö†Ô∏è Execution handled separately by protocol
```

---

## Deployment Process

### Step 1: Deploy ERC-20 Token

You can deploy a standard ERC-20 token to HyperEVM (permissionless):

```bash
cd /Users/macbook/Desktop/etrid/dex-deployment/hyperliquid

# 1. Setup .env
cp .env.example .env
nano .env
# Add your PRIVATE_KEY

# 2. Make sure you have HYPE for gas
# Bridge from Ethereum or buy on Hyperliquid

# 3. Deploy
npm install
npm run deploy:mainnet
```

**Cost:** ~$3-5 (depending on gas)

---

### Step 2: Request Perpetual Market Listing (REQUIRED for trading!)

**Important:** Just deploying the token is NOT enough. You need Hyperliquid team to create a perpetual market.

#### Contact Hyperliquid Team:

1. **Join Discord:**
   ```
   https://discord.gg/hyperliquid
   ```

2. **Find #token-listings or #support channel**

3. **Submit Request:**
   ```

   - Symbol: √âTR
   - Contract: [Your deployed contract address]
   - Total Supply: 1 billion
   - Website: https://etrid.org/
   - Documentation: [Link to docs]

   Project Description:
   - [Brief description of Etrid]
   - Use case: [Explain utility]
   - Community size: [Discord/Telegram members]
   - Liquidity on other chains: [List other DEXes]

   Why Hyperliquid?
   - [Explain why you want perpetual futures]
   - [Target audience: advanced traders]
   - [Commitment to liquidity]

   Please let me know:
   1. Approval requirements
   2. Listing fees (if any)
   3. Timeline
   4. Market parameters (leverage, funding rate, etc.)

   Thank you!
   ```

4. **Provide Required Materials:**
   - Whitepaper or documentation
   - Tokenomics breakdown
   - Team information
   - Audit reports (if available)
   - Proof of liquidity on other chains
   - Community metrics

---

## Approval Timeline

Based on other projects:
- **Initial Response:** 1-3 days
- **Review Process:** 1-2 weeks
- **Market Creation:** 1-3 days after approval
- **Total:** 2-4 weeks typical

---

## Listing Requirements (Estimated)

**May include:**
- ‚úÖ Deployed token on HyperEVM
- ‚úÖ Minimum liquidity on other chains ($100k+)
- ‚úÖ Active community (Discord/Telegram)
- ‚úÖ Clear use case and documentation
- ‚ùì Possible listing fee (check with team)
- ‚ùì Market maker commitment
- ‚ùì KYC for team (depending on policy)

---

## Alternative: Focus on Spot DEXes First

**Recommendation:** If you need trading ASAP, focus on spot DEXes first:

1. **Deploy to Solana, BSC, Base, Arbitrum** (permissionless, immediate)
2. **Create pools on Raydium, PancakeSwap** (no approval needed)
3. **Establish liquidity and community**
4. **Then apply to Hyperliquid** (stronger application with proven track record)

**Benefits:**
- Trading live faster
- Easier approval (already have liquidity)
- Less risky (spot trading more accessible)
- Still get Hyperliquid later

## Technical Notes

### HyperEVM Limitations:

```
‚ö†Ô∏è RPC is read-only
- Can query blockchain
- Cannot send transactions via RPC alone
- Must use Hyperliquid SDK for execution

‚ö†Ô∏è Rate limits: 100 requests/minute/IP
- Use private RPC for production
- Providers: Chainstack, QuickNode, Alchemy

‚ö†Ô∏è Custom execution model
- Not standard EVM execution
- Optimized for derivatives
- May have different gas mechanics
```

### Contract Considerations:

- Standard ERC-20 should work
- Test on testnet first (Chain ID 998)
- Verify contract if explorer supports it
- May need custom integration for perp markets

## FAQ

### Q: Can I deploy without team approval?

**A:** You can deploy the token contract (permissionless), but you need approval to create a perpetual market.

### Q: How much does it cost?

**A:** Deployment ~$3-5. Listing fee unknown (ask team). May require market maker commitment.

### Q: How long does approval take?

**A:** 2-4 weeks typical. Faster if you have proven liquidity elsewhere.

### Q: What if I'm denied?

**A:** You can still trade on other DEXes. Hyperliquid perps are optional, not required.

### Q: Should I do this first?

**A:** NO! Deploy to Solana/BSC/Base/Arbitrum first. Get liquidity established. Then apply to Hyperliquid.

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to permissionless chains first** (Solana, BSC, Base, Arbitrum)
2. **Create pools and add liquidity** ($5k-10k)
3. **Build community** (1-3 months)
4. **Then contact Hyperliquid team** (stronger application)
5. **Deploy to HyperEVM** (when ready)
6. **Request perpetual market**
7. **Wait for approval**
8. **Launch perps trading!**
