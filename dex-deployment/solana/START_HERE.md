## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: Can I test first before spending real money?**
A: Yes! Switch Phantom to Devnet, get free SOL from https://faucet.solana.com, test everything for free.

**Q: How much SOL do I really need?**
A: Minimum 0.1 SOL for token (~$15). Recommended 0.5 SOL for buffer (~$75).

**Q: Will BullX/Phantom auto-detect my token?**
A:
- Phantom: ✅ Instantly (shows in your wallet)
- BullX: ✅ Within 24 hours after pool creation
- Jupiter: ✅ Within 1-2 hours after pool creation

**Q: Can I use my Phantom wallet for deployment?**
A: Yes! That's exactly what we're doing. Two options:
1. Web interface: Uses Phantom directly (easiest)
2. CLI: Import your Phantom key to Solana CLI

**Q: Do I need to create a Raydium pool right away?**
A: No! Deploy the token first ($15), then create pool later when you have liquidity funds ($200+).

**Q: What if I only have $50 budget?**
A: Perfect! Deploy token ($15), save rest for pool creation later. You can add pool anytime after token is deployed.
