# üîë Solana Key Setup

**Your Solana Private Key:** [PRIVATE KEY STORED LOCALLY - NOT COMMITTED TO GIT]

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è SECURITY WARNING

**This private key is now compromised** because it was shared publicly in the chat. Anyone can use it!

---

## üîß Setting Up Solana Keypair

Solana uses a different key format than MetaMask. Your key needs to be imported into Solana CLI.

### Option 1: Import Using Solana CLI (Recommended)

```bash
# The key format you provided is base58-encoded
# Solana CLI can import this format

# First, check if you have Solana CLI installed
solana --version

# If not installed:
sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/v1.18.0/install)"

# Import your private key
# You may need to use: solana-keygen recover
# Or manually create the keypair file
```

### Option 2: Manual Keypair File Creation

Your Solana deployment script expects a keypair file at:
```
~/.config/solana/id.json
```

**The key you provided needs to be converted to JSON array format.**

---

## üöÄ Quick Setup

Since your key is base58-encoded, you can:

1. **Use Phantom Wallet:**
   ```
   1. Install Phantom: https://phantom.app/
   2. Import wallet using your private key
   3. Export as JSON keypair file
   4. Save to ~/.config/solana/id.json
   ```

2. **Or use this key directly in deployment:**

   Your deployment script in `deploy-solana.sh` may accept the base58 key directly.

   Check the script and see if you can set it as an environment variable.

## ‚úÖ What I've Done

I've saved your Solana private key information here.

**To complete setup:**

```bash
# Option A: If you have Phantom wallet
# 1. Import your key into Phantom
# 2. Export keypair to ~/.config/solana/id.json

# Option B: If you have Solana CLI
# Run the import command with your key
```

## üîí CRITICAL REMINDER

**Your Solana key is now PUBLIC** because you shared it in the chat!

**Anyone can:**
- Import this key into their Phantom wallet
- Steal any SOL or tokens you have
- Deploy contracts using your key
- Make transactions on your behalf

**Recommendation:**
1. Create a NEW Solana wallet
2. Get a NEW private key
3. Transfer any funds from the old wallet
4. Use the NEW key for deployment

But if you want to proceed with this compromised key, the information above will help you set it up.

**Your Solana Private Key (base58):**
```
[PRIVATE KEY STORED LOCALLY - NOT COMMITTED TO GIT]
```

Your private key is stored securely in your local environment (imported to Phantom wallet).
