# ‚úÖ EDSC Tokenomics FIXED - Summary

**Date:** October 31, 2025
**Status:** Smart contracts corrected, documentation updated

---

## What Was Wrong

### ‚ùå Incorrect Model I Had (Sorry!)

I incorrectly described EDSC as requiring:
- $1M+ upfront backing before launch
- 150% over-collateralization (like MakerDAO/DAI)
- Users lock √ãTR to borrow EDSC
- Liquidations if collateral drops below 120%
- Interest charges on borrowed positions
- Complex CDP (Collateralized Debt Position) system

**This was COMPLETELY WRONG.**

---

## What's Actually Correct

### ‚úÖ Real EDSC Model (Treasury-Backed)

**EDSC is treasury-backed with organic growth:**

1. **No Pre-Funding:**
   - Deploy contracts (just gas cost)
   - No $1M needed upfront
   - Zero capital required to launch

2. **Mint to Reserve Vault:**
   - All 1 billion EDSC goes to multisig vault
   - NOT to owner, team, or investors
   - Vault holds everything initially

3. **Users Buy EDSC:**
   - User sends BTC/ETH/SOL/USDC to reserve
   - Reserve releases EDSC at $1.00 rate
   - User gets EDSC, reserve gets crypto

4. **Backing Accumulates:**
   - Reserve accumulates crypto from purchases
   - Backing = Purchase value (100% ratio)
   - No over-collateralization needed
   - Organic growth model

5. **Peg Maintenance:**
   - Reserve always buys/sells at $1.00
   - Arbitrage keeps DEX prices near peg
   - No interest rate adjustments needed
   - Simple mechanism

---

## What I Fixed

### ‚úÖ Smart Contracts Updated

**All 6 chains updated:**

**Base:**
```solidity
// OLD (wrong)
constructor(address owner) {
    _mint(owner, 100_000 * 10**18); // ‚ùå Mints to owner
}

// NEW (correct)
constructor(address owner, address reserveVault) {
    _mint(reserveVault, 1_000_000_000 * 10**18); // ‚úÖ Mints to vault
}
```

**Same updates for:**
- ‚úÖ Arbitrum (EdscArbitrum.sol)
- ‚úÖ Polygon (EdscPolygon.sol)
- ‚úÖ BSC (EdscBSC.sol)
- ‚úÖ Ethereum (EdscEthereum.sol)
- ‚úÖ Solana (deploy-edsc-solana.sh)

---

### ‚úÖ Deployment Scripts Updated

**All deployment scripts now:**
```javascript
// Get reserve vault address from .env
const reserveVault = process.env.RESERVE_VAULT || deployer.address;

// Deploy with both owner AND vault
const edsc = await EdscBase.deploy(foundationMultisig, reserveVault);

// 1 billion EDSC goes to vault (not owner)
```

**Updated for all chains:**
- ‚úÖ base/deploy-edsc.js
- ‚úÖ arbitrum/deploy-edsc.js
- ‚úÖ polygon/deploy-edsc.js
- ‚úÖ bsc/deploy-edsc.js
- ‚úÖ ethereum/deploy-edsc.js
- ‚úÖ solana/deploy-edsc-solana.sh

---

### ‚úÖ Documentation Created

1. **EDSC_CORRECT_TOKENOMICS.md**
   - Complete explanation of treasury-backed model
   - How purchases create backing
   - Why no pre-funding needed
   - Comparison to other stablecoin models

2. **RESERVE_VAULT_SETUP.md**

## How EDSC Really Works

### Simple Example

**Day 1: Deploy**
```
Deploy EDSC contract
‚Üì
Mint 1,000,000,000 EDSC
‚Üì
Send ALL to Reserve Vault (multisig)
‚Üì
Circulating supply: 0
Reserve value: $0
```

**Day 2: First Purchase**
```
User wants 10,000 EDSC
‚Üì
User sends 10,000 USDC to vault
‚Üì
Vault releases 10,000 EDSC to user
‚Üì
Circulating: 10,000 EDSC
Reserve: 10,000 USDC ($10,000)
Backing ratio: 100%
```

**After Many Purchases**
```
1000 users buy 1M EDSC total for $1M crypto
‚Üì
Circulating: 1,000,000 EDSC
Reserve holds:
  - $300K USDC (30%)
  - $250K ETH (25%)
  - $200K BTC (20%)
  - $150K SOL (15%)
  - $100K Other (10%)
Total reserve value: $1,000,000
Backing ratio: 100% ‚úÖ
```

---

## Peg Maintenance ($1.00)

### No Complex Mechanisms Needed

**Simple arbitrage maintains peg:**

**If EDSC trades at $1.05 on Uniswap:**
```
Arbitrageur buys from Reserve at $1.00
‚Üì
Sells on Uniswap at $1.05
‚Üì
Profit: $0.05 per EDSC
‚Üì
Selling pressure brings price to $1.00
```

**If EDSC trades at $0.95 on Uniswap:**
```
Arbitrageur buys on Uniswap at $0.95
‚Üì
Redeems with Reserve at $1.00
‚Üì
Profit: $0.05 per EDSC
‚Üì
Buying pressure brings price to $1.00
```

**Reserve always prices EDSC at $1.00, arbitrage does the rest!**

---

## Reserve Vault Address

### Where 1 Billion EDSC Goes

**For mainnet deployment:**
```
Use Foundation multisig (6-of-9)
- 9 Board of Directors addresses
- Requires 6 signatures
- Created on Gnosis Safe
- Same address works on all EVM chains
```

**Set in .env:**
```bash
# Foundation multisig for contract ownership
FOUNDATION_MULTISIG=0xF0undation123...

# Reserve vault for EDSC storage
RESERVE_VAULT=0xVault456...
# (Can be same or different from FOUNDATION_MULTISIG)
```

**For testnet:**
```
Can use your own wallet temporarily
Then transfer to multisig before mainnet
```

---

## Deployment Now

### To Deploy EDSC with Correct Model

**Step 1: Set Reserve Vault**
```bash
cd edsc-stablecoin/base

# Add to .env:
echo "RESERVE_VAULT=0xYourMultisigAddress" >> .env
```

**Step 2: Deploy**
```bash
npm run deploy:mainnet
```

**Step 3: Verify**
```bash
# Check multisig address on Etherscan
# Should show: 1,000,000,000 EDSC balance ‚úÖ
```

**Result:**
- ‚úÖ All EDSC in reserve vault
- ‚úÖ Zero in circulation
- ‚úÖ Ready for users to purchase
- ‚úÖ No backing needed yet (nothing circulating)

## Comparison to Other Stablecoins

| Feature | USDC | DAI (MakerDAO) | EDSC (√ãtrid) |
|---------|------|----------------|--------------|
| **Model** | Fiat-backed | Over-collateralized | Treasury-backed |
| **Backing** | 1:1 USD in bank | 150%+ crypto | 100% from purchases |
| **Launch Cost** | Huge (banking) | $1M-$150M | $0 (gas only) |
| **Centralization** | High (Circle) | Low (decentralized) | Low (multisig) |
| **Peg Method** | Redemption | Interest rates | Reserve buy/sell |
| **Liquidations** | None | Yes | None |
| **Complexity** | Simple | Very complex | Simple |

**EDSC = Simple + Decentralized + No upfront capital needed!**
