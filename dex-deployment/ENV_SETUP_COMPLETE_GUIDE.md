# üîß .ENV SETUP COMPLETE GUIDE

**Status:** ‚úÖ .env files created, npm dependencies installed
**What's Left:** Add your PRIVATE_KEY to each .env file

---

## ‚úÖ WHAT I JUST DID FOR YOU

### 1. Created .env Files:
- ‚úÖ `base/.env` (copied from .env.example)
- ‚úÖ `arbitrum/.env` (copied from .env.example)
- ‚úÖ `hyperliquid/.env` (copied from .env.example)

### 2. Installed npm Dependencies:
- ‚úÖ `base/node_modules/` (Hardhat, OpenZeppelin, etc.)
- ‚úÖ `arbitrum/node_modules/` (Hardhat, OpenZeppelin, etc.)
- ‚úÖ `hyperliquid/node_modules/` (Hardhat, OpenZeppelin, etc.)

### 3. What You Need to Do:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Add your PRIVATE_KEY to each .env file
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Get API keys for block explorers (optional but recommended)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Get gas tokens for each chain

---

## üîë STEP 1: Export Your Private Key

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Keep your private key SECRET! Never share it or commit to git!**

### Option A: Using MetaMask (for Base & Arbitrum)

1. **Open MetaMask**
2. **Click** the account icon (top right)
3. **Click** "Account details"
4. **Click** "Show private key"
5. **Enter** your MetaMask password
6. **Copy** the private key (starts with `0x`)

**Example:** `0xabc123def456789...` (64 characters after 0x)

### Option B: Using Existing Key

If you already have a private key from BSC or Polygon deployment, you can use the SAME key for Base and Arbitrum (they're all EVM chains).

---

## üîß STEP 2: Add Private Key to .env Files

### Base:

```bash
cd /Users/macbook/Desktop/etrid/dex-deployment/base
nano .env
```

Find this line:
```
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
```

Change to:
```
PRIVATE_KEY=0xYOUR_ACTUAL_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE
```

**Save:** Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X

---

### Arbitrum:

```bash
cd /Users/macbook/Desktop/etrid/dex-deployment/arbitrum
nano .env
```

Find this line:
```
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
```

Change to:
```
PRIVATE_KEY=0xYOUR_ACTUAL_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE
```

**Save:** Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X

**Note:** You can use the SAME private key as Base!

---

### Hyperliquid:

```bash
cd /Users/macbook/Desktop/etrid/dex-deployment/hyperliquid
nano .env
```

Find this line:
```
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
```

Change to:
```
PRIVATE_KEY=0xYOUR_ACTUAL_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE
```

**Save:** Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X

**Note:** You can use the SAME private key as Base/Arbitrum!

---

## üé´ STEP 3: Get API Keys (Optional but Recommended)

### Base - Get BaseScan API Key:

1. **Go to:** https://basescan.org/myapikey
2. **Sign up** for free account
3. **Create** new API key
4. **Copy** the API key

**Add to base/.env:**
```bash
nano base/.env
```

Find:
```
BASESCAN_API_KEY=your_basescan_api_key_here
```

Change to:
```
BASESCAN_API_KEY=YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY
```

---

### Arbitrum - Get Arbiscan API Key:

1. **Go to:** https://arbiscan.io/myapikey
2. **Sign up** for free account
3. **Create** new API key

**Add to arbitrum/.env:**
```bash
nano arbitrum/.env
```

Find:
```
ARBISCAN_API_KEY=your_arbiscan_api_key_here
```

Change to:
```
ARBISCAN_API_KEY=YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY
```

---

5. Check Base balance in MetaMask
```

**Option 2: Buy on Exchange**
```
1. Buy ETH on Coinbase
2. Withdraw to Base network
3. Use your MetaMask address
4. Select "Base" as network
```

**Check balance:**
```bash
# Add Base network to MetaMask if not already:

```

---

### Hyperliquid - Get HYPE:

**Amount needed:** ~0.01-0.05 HYPE (~$5-25, depends on HYPE price)

**‚ö†Ô∏è This is more complex!**

**Option 1: Bridge from Ethereum**
```
Check Hyperliquid docs for official bridge:
https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/

May require:
1. Connect to Hyperliquid platform
2. Bridge ETH ‚Üí HYPE

## üîí SECURITY REMINDERS

1. **NEVER commit .env files to git**
   ```bash
   # Already in .gitignore, but double-check:
   cat /Users/macbook/Desktop/etrid/dex-deployment/.gitignore | grep .env
   ```

2. **NEVER share your private key**
   - Not on Discord
   - Not on Telegram
   - Not in screenshots
   - Not anywhere!

3. **Use a dedicated wallet for deployments**
   - Don't use your main wallet
   - Create a new MetaMask account for deployments
   - Only fund with what you need

4. **Backup your private key securely**
   - Write it down on paper
   - Store in password manager
   - Keep multiple copies in safe places

---

## üÜò TROUBLESHOOTING

### "insufficient funds for gas"

**Solution:** Get more ETH/HYPE on that chain. See Step 4.

### "invalid private key"

**Solution:**
- Make sure it starts with `0x`
- 66 characters total (0x + 64 hex chars)
- No spaces or line breaks

### "network request failed"

**Solution:**
- Check internet connection
- Try alternative RPC in hardhat.config.js
- Wait and retry (network might be congested)

### "contract verification failed"

**Solution:**
- Make sure API key is valid
- Wait 30 seconds after deployment
- Try manual verification:
  ```bash
  npx hardhat verify --network mainnet CONTRACT_ADDRESS
  ```

---

## ‚úÖ QUICK SUMMARY

**What's Done:**
- ‚úÖ .env files created (base, arbitrum, hyperliquid)
