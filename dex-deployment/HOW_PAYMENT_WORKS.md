# 💰 How Payment Actually Works - Step by Step

**Question:** "When I run the script, how do I spend $15.50? Will I be prompted?"

**Answer:** The script doesn't directly charge you. Here's what ACTUALLY happens:

---

## 🔑 The Key Concept

**The script runs blockchain transactions that require gas fees.**

- The script is FREE to run
- But blockchain transactions COST gas fees
- Gas fees are paid from YOUR crypto wallet
- You need crypto in your wallet BEFORE running the script

---

## 📋 Step-by-Step: What Actually Happens

### Before You Run the Script:

**1. You Need Crypto in Your Wallet**

```
Required:
├─ Polygon: 10 MATIC (~$10) in your wallet
├─ BSC: 0.02 BNB (~$6) in your wallet
└─ Solana: 0.05 SOL (~$7.50) in your wallet

Total: ~$23.50 worth of crypto
(You need more than $15.50 because you need crypto on each chain)
```

**Where to get crypto:**
- Buy on Coinbase, Binance, Kraken
- Send to your MetaMask/Phantom wallet
- Make sure you have the RIGHT chain selected

---

### When You Run the Script:

**Step 1: Script Starts**

```bash
./DEPLOY_CONTRACTS_ONLY.sh
```

The script just reads files and prepares commands. **NO money spent yet.**

---

**Step 2: Script Deploys to Polygon**

The script runs:
```bash
npm run deploy:mainnet
```

This creates a blockchain transaction. Here's what happens:

```
1. Hardhat reads your .env file
   └─ Gets your PRIVATE_KEY

2. Hardhat creates a transaction:
   - Deploy EtridPoly.sol contract
   - Gas needed: ~0.001 ETH worth of gas (5 MATIC)

3. Hardhat sends transaction to Polygon network

4. Polygon network processes it:
   - Deducts 5 MATIC from your wallet address
   - Deploys the contract
   - Returns transaction hash

5. Script continues...
```

**❗ IMPORTANT: This happens AUTOMATICALLY**

- The script uses your private key from `.env`
- The transaction is sent automatically
- Money is deducted from your wallet automatically
- **NO pop-up, NO prompt to confirm**

**This is why:**
- You need crypto in your wallet FIRST
- The private key in `.env` authorizes spending
- The script can spend up to your wallet balance

---

**Step 3: Script Deploys to BSC**

Same process:
```
1. Script runs: npm run deploy:mainnet (in bsc folder)
2. Uses your PRIVATE_KEY from bsc/.env
3. Sends transaction to BSC network
4. Deducts ~0.02 BNB (~$6) from your wallet
5. Deploys contract
6. No prompt - happens automatically
```

---

**Step 4: Script Deploys to Solana**

```
1. Script runs: ./deploy-solana.sh
2. Uses your Solana keypair (~/.config/solana/id.json)
3. Sends transaction to Solana network
4. Deducts ~0.05 SOL (~$7.50) from your wallet
5. Creates SPL token
6. No prompt - happens automatically
```

---

**Step 5: Script Finishes**

```
✅ All contracts deployed!
Total spent from your wallets:
  - Polygon wallet: 5 MATIC (~$5)
  - BSC wallet: 0.02 BNB (~$6)
  - Solana wallet: 0.05 SOL (~$4.50)
  ────────────────────────────────
  Total: $15.50 (automatically deducted)
```

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: How Private Keys Work

### Your Private Key = Your Bank Card PIN

When you put your `PRIVATE_KEY` in the `.env` file:

```bash
# .env file
PRIVATE_KEY=0xabc123def456...
```

**This is like giving the script your bank card PIN!**

The script can:
- ✅ Send transactions from your wallet
- ✅ Spend your crypto (up to your balance)
- ✅ Deploy contracts
- ✅ Create pools
- ❌ But CANNOT spend more than you have

**This is why:**
- You MUST keep `.env` files SECRET
- NEVER commit to git
- NEVER share with anyone
- The script has full control over that wallet

---

## 🎯 The Actual Workflow

### What You Need to Do:

**Before Running Script:**

```bash
# 1. Create wallets and get crypto
# ─────────────────────────────────

# Polygon:
# • Create MetaMask wallet (or use existing)
# • Switch to Polygon network
# • Buy 10 MATIC on Binance/Coinbase
# • Send to your MetaMask address
# • Confirm received: check balance in MetaMask

# BSC:
# • Same MetaMask wallet (can use same address!)
# • Switch to BSC network
# • Buy 0.02 BNB on Binance
# • Send to your MetaMask address
# • Confirm received

# Solana:
# • Create Phantom wallet (or use existing)
# • Buy 0.1 SOL on Coinbase
# • Send to your Phantom address
# • Confirm received

# 2. Export private keys
# ─────────────────────

# MetaMask:
# • Click account icon → Account details → Export private key
# • Enter password
# • Copy private key (looks like: 0xabc123def456...)

# Phantom (Solana):
# • Settings → Export Private Key
# • Copy keypair file to ~/.config/solana/id.json

# 3. Add to .env files
# ─────────────────────

# Polygon:
cd ~/Desktop/etrid/dex-deployment/polygon
cp .env.example .env
nano .env
# Paste: PRIVATE_KEY=0xabc123def456...

# BSC:
cd ../bsc
cp .env.example .env
nano .env
# Paste: PRIVATE_KEY=0xabc123def456...  (can be same as Polygon!)

# Solana:
# Just make sure ~/.config/solana/id.json exists with your keypair

# 4. Run the script!
# ─────────────────────

cd ~/Desktop/etrid/dex-deployment
./DEPLOY_CONTRACTS_ONLY.sh

# Script will:
# • Read your private keys
# • Send transactions automatically
# • Deduct gas fees from your wallets
# • Deploy contracts
# • Done!
```

## ❓ Common Questions

### Q: "Will I get a MetaMask pop-up to approve?"

**A: NO!**

- Scripts use private key directly
- Bypasses MetaMask UI
- Transactions sent automatically
- No pop-up, no confirmation

**If you WANT pop-ups:**
- Don't use deployment scripts
- Deploy manually via MetaMask
- More clicks, but you see each transaction

### Q: "What if I don't have enough crypto?"

**A: Transaction will FAIL**

Example:
```bash
Error: insufficient funds for gas * price + value
```

Script will stop and show error. No money lost.

### Q: "Can the script spend MORE than $15.50?"

**A: Only if:**
- Gas prices spike (network congestion)
- You have more transactions than expected
- But it CAN'T spend more than your wallet balance

**Safety:** You can only lose what's in your wallet

### Q: "Where does the $15.50 go?"

**A: To blockchain validators**

- Polygon: $5 → Polygon validators
- BSC: $6 → BSC validators
- Solana: $4.50 → Solana validators

**NOT to:**
- ❌ The script author
- ❌ PancakeSwap/Uniswap/DEXes
- ❌ Any company

Gas fees = payment to decentralized network validators

### Q: "Is this safe?"

**A: YES, if:**
- ✅ You keep private keys secret
- ✅ You use the official scripts (not modified)
- ✅ You understand what the script does
- ✅ You only run on mainnet when ready

**NOT safe if:**
- ❌ You share your private key
- ❌ You run scripts you don't understand
- ❌ Someone else has access to your .env files

---

## 🛡️ Safety Checklist

Before running ANY script with your private key:

- [ ] I understand the script will spend my crypto automatically
- [ ] I have reviewed the deployment scripts
- [ ] I have enough crypto in my wallets
- [ ] My private keys are in .env files (not committed to git)
- [ ] I understand I might lose some crypto to gas fees
- [ ] I'm ready to deploy to mainnet (or I'm testing on testnet)
- [ ] I've tested on testnet first
- [ ] I know I WON'T get pop-ups to confirm

---

## 💡 Alternative: Manual Deployment (With Pop-ups)

**If you want to see each transaction and approve manually:**

Don't use the script. Deploy manually:

```bash
# Polygon (Manual):
cd polygon
npm run deploy:mainnet

# You'll see:
"Deploy EtridPoly? Cost: 5 MATIC"
[Approve in MetaMask] ← YOU CLICK THIS

# BSC (Manual):
cd ../bsc
npm run deploy:mainnet

[Approve in MetaMask] ← YOU CLICK THIS

# This way you see and approve each transaction
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ You see each transaction
- ✅ Can cancel if something looks wrong
- ✅ More control

**Cons:**
- ❌ More manual work
- ❌ Can't automate
- ❌ Might miss steps

---

## 🎯 TL;DR: How Payment Actually Works

1. **Before script:** You buy crypto and put in wallets
2. **Run script:** It uses your private key to send transactions
3. **Transactions:** Automatically deduct gas fees from wallets
4. **No pop-ups:** Everything happens automatically
5. **Total cost:** ~$15.50 in gas fees (paid to validators)
6. **Result:** Contracts deployed, ÉTR tokens created

**Think of it like:**
- Private key = ATM card PIN
- Script = ATM machine
- Gas fees = ATM withdrawal fees
- Automatic = No cashier asking for confirmation
