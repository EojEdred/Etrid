## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
**Target:** 90% code coverage

- Every pallet function has success/failure tests
- All error conditions exercised
- Edge cases (overflow, empty inputs, max values) covered
- Mock runtime for isolation

**Gap:** ~400 unit tests needed

### Integration Tests
**Target:** All cross-component flows tested

- EDSC bridge full redemption flow
- Lightning Bloc multi-hop payment
- Validator committee rotation with ASF
- DID registration and resolution
- Cross-chain token transfer

**Gap:** ~80 integration tests needed

### Property-Based Tests
**Current:** 57 tests (excellent!)

**Expand:**
- ASF consensus properties (safety, liveness)
- Bridge invariants (TVL conservation)
- VM gas metering (no free execution)
- Staking economics (no mint bug)

**Gap:** ~40 property tests needed

### E2E Tests
**Target:** Full user flows automated

- Wallet: Create account → send transaction → receive → stake
- Bridge: Deposit → wait confirmations → mint → redeem
- Contracts: Deploy → call → event verification
- Governance: Propose → vote → execute

**Gap:** ~30 E2E tests needed

### Stress Tests
**Target:** Production load validation

- 1000 validators running simultaneously
- 10K transactions per second
- 1M concurrent Lightning channels
- 72-hour continuous operation

**Gap:** All stress tests missing

### Security Tests
**Target:** Attack resistance verification

- Byzantine validators (33% malicious)
- Bridge double-spend attempts
- Contract reentrancy attacks
- Network DDoS simulation
- Oracle manipulation scenarios

**Gap:** ~50 security tests needed
