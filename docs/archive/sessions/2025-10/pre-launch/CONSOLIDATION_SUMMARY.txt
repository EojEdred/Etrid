========================================
CONSOLIDATION STRATEGY
========================================

Thematic Grouping:
- Quick Start + Architecture + Contributing → DEVELOPER_GUIDE
- Deployment + Security → DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE  
- Week 0 + GenesisBuilder Session → PROJECT_HISTORY
- Test scripts → TESTING_GUIDE (new)
- etrvalueref.md → VALUE_REFERENCE.md (renamed for consistency)

========================================
COMMANDS USED
========================================

Created: consolidate_docs.sh (automated script)
Executed: ./consolidate_docs.sh
Result: All 7 files created, originals archived

========================================
VERIFICATION
========================================

Before:
- 11 markdown files in root
- Scattered documentation
- Duplicate/overlapping content

After:
- 7 markdown files in root
- Organized by purpose
- Clear navigation in README
- All content preserved in archive

========================================
NEXT STEPS
========================================

Documentation is now consolidated and organized!

Future maintenance:
1. Update KNOWN_ISSUES.md as issues are resolved
2. Add new sessions to PROJECT_HISTORY.md
3. Update DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md when architecture changes
4. Keep TESTING_GUIDE.md current with new test scripts

Archive is always available at docs/archive/ for reference.
