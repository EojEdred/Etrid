I'm continuing work on Ëtrid Protocol's DEX expansion. The previous Claude Code session just completed a comprehensive multi-chain DEX framework.

**Project Location:** /Users/macbook/Desktop/etrid

**What was completed:**
✅ Complete Ethereum contracts (ETR, EDSC, Bridge) - production ready
✅ Base L2 contracts (EVM clone ready)
✅ Multi-chain bridge adapters (TypeScript)
✅ Hyperliquid & BullEx integrations
✅ Phantom wallet SDK integration
✅ Unified deployment script (deploy-all-chains.sh)
✅ Comprehensive documentation (6 major docs)

**Current Status:**
- Ethereum contracts: READY TO DEPLOY (not yet deployed)
- All other chains: Framework complete, ready to implement
- Background process: cargo test --workspace --lib (shell d6b623) still running

**Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order):**
1. Deploy Ethereum contracts to Sepolia testnet
2. Create Uniswap pools on Sepolia
3. Test Base bridge adapter connectivity
4. Deploy Base L2 contracts
5. Test end-to-end bridge flow (lock → mint)

**Key Files to Start With:**
- HANDOFF_TO_NEXT_SESSION.md (complete handoff document - READ THIS FIRST)
- START_HERE_DEX.md (quick reference)
- DEX_QUICK_START.md (deployment guide)

**First Commands:**
cd /Users/macbook/Desktop/etrid
cat HANDOFF_TO_NEXT_SESSION.md  # Read full context
cd contracts/ethereum
npm install && npm test  # Test Ethereum contracts

**Goal:** Deploy Phase 1 (Ethereum) to Sepolia and test bridge adapter.

Please read HANDOFF_TO_NEXT_SESSION.md for complete context, then proceed with deploying and testing the Ethereum contracts on Sepolia.
