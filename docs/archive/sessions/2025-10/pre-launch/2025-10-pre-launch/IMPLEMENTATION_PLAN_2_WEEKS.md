# 2-Week Implementation Plan: Exchange Expansion Launch

**Version**: 1.0
**Start Date**: October 28, 2025 (Week 1 begins Monday)
**Target Launch**: November 11, 2025 (2 weeks)
**Strategy**: Community LP Rewards (Zero-Cash Bootstrap)

---

## 🎯 **Mission Statement**

Launch ÉTR on BSC (PancakeSwap) and Solana (Raydium) with **$0 upfront liquidity**, using 20M ÉTR Community LP rewards to attract early liquidity providers.

**Why these chains**:
- **BSC**: $5-20 gas (cheapest EVM chain)
- **Solana**: $0.50 gas (cheapest non-EVM chain)
- **Skip Base L2** initially (too expensive — $50-150 gas)

**Total Cash Needed**: **$8-26** (absolute minimum for gas)

---

## 🆘 **Emergency Contacts / Escalation**

**If deployment fails**:
1. Check gas fees (may need to wait for lower gas)
2. Verify RPC endpoint working (try backup: Alchemy, Infura, QuickNode)
3. Check deployer wallet has sufficient balance

**If LP rewards contract has bug**:
1. Pause contract immediately (if possible)
2. Communicate to community transparently
3. Deploy fixed version, migrate users

**If community response is weak**:
1. Increase APR temporarily (e.g., 200% for first week)
2. Launch bounty campaign (refer-a-friend rewards)
3. Partner with influencers (pay in ÉTR, not USD)
