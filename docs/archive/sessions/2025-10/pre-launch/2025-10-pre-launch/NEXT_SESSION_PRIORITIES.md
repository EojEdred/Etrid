# Next Session Priorities - √ãtrid Protocol

**Date:** October 24, 2025
**Session Completed:** AI Devs Deployment ‚úÖ
**Next Focus:** Oracle Tests + Infrastructure Planning

---

## üéØ Immediate Priorities (Next 1-2 Hours)

### 1. Fix pallet-reserve-oracle Test Compilation Errors üî¥ HIGH
**Status:** Blocking test coverage report
**Location:** `pallets/pallet-reserve-oracle/src/lib.rs`
**Estimated Time:** 2-4 hours
**Impact:** Unblocks 90% test coverage goal

**Why Now:**
- Currently at 87.3% coverage, need 90%
- Tests failing prevent accurate coverage measurement
- Identified in KNOWN_ISSUES.md as priority fix

**Approach:**
1. Read error output from test compilation
2. Fix type mismatches and API changes
3. Update tests to match current pallet implementation
4. Run full test suite to verify
5. Update LIVING_ROADMAP when complete

---

## üöÄ Short-Term Priorities (This Week - Oct 24-31)

### 2. Begin Infrastructure Planning üü° MEDIUM
**Status:** Not started
**Timeline:** This week
**Deliverable:** Infrastructure deployment plan

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Research VPS providers (Hetzner, OVH, AWS)
- [ ] Price comparison for 3 validators + 13 collators
- [ ] Identify monitoring stack requirements
- [ ] Plan DNS and SSL certificate setup
- [ ] Create deployment checklist

**Budget Target:** $1,500-2,000/month

---

### 3. Test AI Devs Skills Execution üü¢ LOW
**Status:** Deployed but not tested
**Next Steps:** Execute individual skills

**Test Plan:**
```bash
# Test Compiler AI
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/execute \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "agent_name": "compiler",
    "skill_name": "etrid-compile-build",
    "parameters": {}
  }'

# Test Governance AI
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/trigger/governance?proposal_type=treasury

# Monitor logs
docker compose logs -f ai-devs
```

**Success Criteria:**
- At least 3 skills execute successfully
- No crashes or errors in orchestrator
- VectorDB stores execution history
- Claude API integration working

---

### 4. Update Component Documentation üü° MEDIUM
**Status:** Documentation mentions "testnet" but should reference "Ember"
**Impact:** Better clarity for external contributors

**Files to Update (13 components):**
- `01-identity/did/pallet/README.md`
- `02-consensus/asf-consensus/pallet/README.md`
- `03-security/multisig/pallet/README.md`
- `04-accounts/pallet/README.md`
- ... (9 more)

**Change Pattern:**
- Find: "testnet"
- Replace: "Ember testnet"
- Add: Launch timeline (Q1 2026)

---

## üìÖ Medium-Term Priorities (Next 1-2 Weeks)

### 5. Security Audit Quotes
**Status:** Not started
**Action:** Contact 2-3 audit firms

**Firms to Contact:**
1. Quantstamp
2. Trail of Bits
3. OpenZeppelin

**Information Needed:**
- Timeline availability (Q1 2026)
- Cost estimates
- Scope of audit (which pallets)
- Duration (weeks)

---

### 6. Connect AI Devs to √ãtrid Node
**Status:** etrid-node not running yet
**Prerequisite:** Build √ãtrid binary first

**Steps:**
1. Uncomment etrid-node service in docker-compose.yml
2. Build Substrate binary: `cargo build --release`
3. Start node with `--dev --ws-external`
4. Update AI Devs to connect to ws://etrid-node:9944
5. Test blockchain_client.py connection

---

### 7. Deploy Monitoring Stack
**Status:** Grafana running, Prometheus config error
**Next:** Fix Prometheus config and create dashboards

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Fix prometheus.yml mount in Docker
- [ ] Create Grafana datasource for Prometheus
- [ ] Import substrate-node dashboard
- [ ] Create AI Devs metrics dashboard
- [ ] Set up alerting rules

---

## üéì Learning & Research Tasks

### 8. Evaluate Infrastructure Providers
**Research Questions:**
- Which VPS provider offers best price/performance?
- Do we need dedicated servers or VPS?
- What about bare metal for validators?
- Backup and disaster recovery strategy?

**Deliverable:** Infrastructure recommendation document

---

### 9. Community Setup Planning
**Status:** No community infrastructure yet
**Next:** Draft community strategy

**Platforms to Consider:**
- Discord (primary)
- Telegram (announcements)
- Twitter/X (marketing)
- GitHub Discussions (technical)
- Forum (governance)

**Timeline:** Set up before Ember launch

---

## ‚úÖ What's Already Done (This Session)

## üöß Known Blockers

### Critical Path Blockers
1. **Oracle pallet tests failing** - Blocks test coverage goal
2. **No infrastructure deployed** - Blocks Ember testnet launch
3. **Security audits not scheduled** - Long lead times may delay mainnet

### Non-Blocking Issues
- Prometheus config error (monitoring works via Grafana)
- etrid-node not running (not needed for AI Devs testing)
- Notion API keys not configured (optional integration)

---

## üí° Recommendations for Next Session

### Option A: Fix Oracle Tests First (Recommended)
**Reasoning:** Quick win, unblocks test coverage, high priority
**Time:** 2-4 hours
**Impact:** Immediate progress on Alpha ‚Üí Ember transition

### Option B: Infrastructure Planning
**Reasoning:** Long lead time activity, start sooner
**Time:** 3-5 hours research
**Impact:** Critical path for Ember launch

### Option C: Test AI Devs Skills
**Reasoning:** Validate deployment, find issues early
**Time:** 1-2 hours
**Impact:** Confidence in AI Devs system

**Best Approach:** Do A (oracle tests) first, then C (test AI Devs), then start B (infrastructure research)
