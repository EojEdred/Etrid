## Why These Files Were Archived

1. **Superseded**: Newer documentation contains the same information
2. **Completed**: Scripts finished their one-time migrations
3. **Historical**: Valuable context but not needed for active development
4. **Consolidation**: Reduced from 47 files to 3 readable documents
