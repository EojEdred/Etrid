- Treasury migrated to new multisig within 14 days of election

**Emergency Rotation** (Within 24 hours if):
- Director key compromised or suspected compromise
- Hardware wallet lost or stolen
- Phishing attempt successful
- Security audit recommends rotation

**Rotation Process**:
1. All affected Directors generate new keys
2. Create new multisig account

4. Migrate treasury funds (requires 7-of-9 old + new sigs)
5. Verify migration complete
6. Revoke old multisig authority
7. Update all systems and documentation
