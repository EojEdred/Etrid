## Security Posture

### Multi-Layer Security

**Layer 1: Smart Contracts**
- M-of-N signature threshold (3-of-5 attesters)
- Nonce-based replay protection
- Duplicate message prevention
- Emergency pause mechanism
- Multisig admin control

**Layer 2: Infrastructure**
- Server hardening (firewall, SSH keys, fail2ban)
- DDoS protection (Cloudflare)
- HTTPS/TLS for all endpoints
- Rate limiting on APIs
- Network segmentation

**Layer 3: Operational**
- Private key security (HSM/encrypted storage)
- Secrets management (Vault/AWS Secrets Manager)
- Access control (MFA, least privilege)
- Audit logging
- Regular security reviews

**Layer 4: Monitoring & Response**
- 24/7 monitoring with alerts
- Automated anomaly detection
- Incident response procedures
- On-call rotation
- Post-incident reviews

### Risk Mitigation

| Threat | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Residual Risk |
|--------|------------|--------|------------|---------------|
| Smart contract exploit | Low | Critical | Audits (2x), formal verification, bug bounty | Low |
| Attester compromise | Low | High | HSM, M-of-N threshold, key rotation | Low |
| Relayer failure | Medium | Low | Multiple independent relayers | Very Low |
| Chain RPC outage | Medium | Medium | Backup RPC providers | Low |
| DDoS attack | Medium | Medium | Cloudflare, rate limiting | Low |
| High gas prices | High | Low | Gas limits, pause mechanism | Acceptable |
