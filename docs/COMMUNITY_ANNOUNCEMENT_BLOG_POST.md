## üåü What's Happening?

Today marks a major milestone for √ãtrid Protocol: **√âTR is officially expanding beyond our native blockchain to two of the largest DeFi ecosystems** - Binance Smart Chain and Solana.

But we're not stopping at simple token deployment. **We're launching a 6-month Community LP Rewards program** that incentivizes YOU - our community - to become the liquidity providers that make this expansion successful.

**No investors. No venture capital. No IDO. Just the community building liquidity together.**

---

## üíé Why This Matters

### For √âTR Holders

- **New trading venues**: Trade √âTR on PancakeSwap and Raydium with deep liquidity
- **Lower fees**: BSC and Solana offer 100x-1000x cheaper gas than Ethereum
- **Faster transactions**: 3-second finality on BSC, 400ms on Solana
- **Earn passive income**: Provide liquidity and earn high APR rewards

### For the √ãtrid Ecosystem

- **Increased accessibility**: Millions of BSC and Solana users can now access √âTR
- **Price discovery**: More markets = more accurate pricing
- **Trading volume**: Liquidity attracts traders, which attracts more liquidity (flywheel effect)
- **Path to major CEXs**: Proven DEX liquidity is a requirement for Binance, Coinbase, OKX listings

### For DeFi as a Whole

- **Proof of community-driven liquidity**: We're showing that projects don't need VC funding to bootstrap liquidity
- **Innovative tokenomics**: Our algorithmic stablecoin (EDSC) paired with √âTR creates unique arbitrage opportunities
- **Cross-chain composability**: √âTR on BSC/Solana can be used in yield farming, lending, and other DeFi protocols

## üéÅ Community LP Rewards Program

### How It Works

1. **Provide liquidity** on PancakeSwap (√âTR/BNB) or Raydium (√âTR/SOL)
2. **Stake your LP tokens** in our rewards contract
3. **Earn √âTR rewards** automatically every block
4. **Withdraw anytime** - no lock-up period

### Reward Schedule (6 Months)

| Month | APR | √âTR Rewards | Target TVL |
|-------|-----|-------------|------------|
| **Month 1** | **150%** | 2,500,000 | $50,000 |
| Month 2 | 120% | 3,500,000 | $100,000 |
| Month 3 | 90% | 4,000,000 | $200,000 |
| Month 4 | 70% | 4,000,000 | $350,000 |
| Month 5 | 50% | 3,500,000 | $500,000 |
| Month 6 | 35% | 2,500,000 | $750,000 |
| **TOTAL** | - | **20,000,000** | **$750k+** |

**Why time-decaying APR?**
- Early supporters get the highest rewards (150% in Month 1!)
- APR adjusts as TVL grows (more liquidity = lower APR, but still attractive)
- Transition to sustainable, fee-based model by Month 7

### Example Earnings

**Scenario**: You provide $1,000 in liquidity during Month 1

- **Your share**: $1,000 / $50,000 TVL = 2% of pool
- **Your rewards**: 2% √ó 2,500,000 √âTR = 50,000 √âTR
- **Value at $0.01/√âTR**: $500
- **ROI**: $500 / $1,000 = **50% in one month** (600% annualized)

**Plus**:
- Trading fees (0.25% per swap)
- √âTR price appreciation (if price goes up, your rewards are worth more)
- Compounding (reinvest rewards for exponential growth)

## üìä Token Allocation Transparency

### Where Are These 20M √âTR Coming From?

**Total √âTR Supply**: 2,500,000,000 (2.5 billion)

**Community Liquidity Pool**: 250,000,000 (10% of total supply)

**Exchange Expansion Allocation**: 32,000,000 (1.28% of total supply)

| Allocation | Amount | Purpose |
|------------|--------|---------|
| Community LP Rewards | 20,000,000 √âTR | This program (8% of Community LP Pool) |
| Maintenance Rewards | 2,000,000 √âTR | Month 7-12 sustainability |
| Founder Bootstrap | 10,000,000 √âTR | Initial seed pools (from founder's allocation) |
| **Total Year 1** | **32,000,000 √âTR** | **1.28% of total supply** |

**Remaining for Future Expansion**: 218,000,000 √âTR (87.2% of Community LP Pool)

**Key Insight**: We're using less than **1.3% of total √âTR supply** for this initial expansion, leaving **tons of runway** for scaling to 50+ exchanges without diluting holders.

## üîê Security & Trust

### Smart Contract Audits

- **MasterChef V2 Fork**: Based on PancakeSwap's battle-tested contract (audited by CertiK)
- **No Custom Modifications**: Using proven, unmodified code to avoid audit costs
- **Open Source**: All contracts published on GitHub and verified on BscScan/Solscan
- **Multi-Sig Governance**: Admin functions controlled by 3-of-5 multi-signature wallet

### Risk Disclosure

**Like all DeFi, providing liquidity has risks**:

1. **Impermanent Loss**: If √âTR price changes significantly vs. BNB/SOL, you may lose value compared to just holding
2. **Smart Contract Risk**: Although we use audited code, bugs can exist
3. **Market Risk**: √âTR price volatility affects your LP position value
4. **APR Not Guaranteed**: APR may change if TVL differs from targets

**Mitigation**:
- Start small and learn (e.g., $100-500 test deposit)
- Only provide liquidity you can afford to lose
- Diversify across multiple pools/strategies
- Monitor impermanent loss calculators

## ‚ùì FAQ

### Q: Do I need to hold √âTR on the native √ãtrid blockchain to participate?

**A**: No! You can buy √âTR directly on PancakeSwap or Raydium using BNB or SOL. The bridged √âTR on BSC/Solana is equivalent to native √âTR (1:1 backed).

### Q: Can I withdraw my liquidity before 6 months?

**A**: Yes! There's **no lock-up period**. You can withdraw your LP tokens anytime. However, you'll earn more if you stay longer (due to compounding).

### Q: What happens after Month 6 when rewards decrease to 35% APR?

**A**: We'll transition to a maintenance phase (Month 7-12) with 10-20% APR, funded by trading fees. Eventually, the pool becomes self-sustaining via fees alone.

### Q: How do I bridge √âTR between chains (e.g., √ãtrid ‚Üí BSC)?

**A**: Use our native bridge at [bridge.etrid.io](https://bridge.etrid.io). Transactions typically finalize within 5-10 minutes. Fees: 0.1% of bridged amount.

### Q: Is this an airdrop or free money?

**A**: No. You must **provide liquidity** (bring your own BNB/SOL + √âTR) and take on the risk of impermanent loss and market volatility. Rewards compensate for that risk.

### Q: Why not launch on Ethereum or Base L2 first?

**A**: Gas costs. Deploying on Ethereum would cost $500-2,000 just in gas fees, and Base L2 is $50-150. BSC ($5-20) and Solana ($0.50-3) are **100x cheaper**, allowing us to launch with minimal budget.

### Q: Can I stake √âTR without providing liquidity?

**A**: Not in this program. This is specifically for **liquidity providers** who pair √âTR with BNB or SOL. Native √âTR staking on √ãtrid blockchain is separate (see [Validator Staking](https://etrid.io/staking)).

### Q: What if √âTR price crashes? Will I lose money?

**A**: Your LP position value depends on both √âTR and BNB/SOL prices. If √âTR crashes, you'll experience impermanent loss. However, the high APR rewards are designed to offset this risk. **Always provide only what you can afford to lose.**

### Q: Who controls the reward emissions? Can the team rug pull?

**A**: The MasterChef contract is controlled by a **3-of-5 multi-signature wallet** (governance members), NOT a single person. All admin functions have a **24-hour timelock**, giving the community time to react to any changes. The contract is **open source and verified** - you can read the code yourself.
