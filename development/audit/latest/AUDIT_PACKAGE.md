---

## 1. Security Assumptions

### 1.1 Cryptographic Assumptions

**Signature Schemes:**
- **SR25519:** Used for validator signatures, block authoring, consensus messages
- **ECDSA (secp256k1):** Used for cross-chain custodian signatures (Ethereum compatibility)
- **Ed25519:** Optional for future integrations

**Assumptions:**
- Discrete logarithm problem remains computationally infeasible
- No quantum attacks within 5-year horizon (post-quantum migration planned for v2.0)
- Entropy sources for key generation are cryptographically secure

**Hash Functions:**
- **Blake2b-256:** Block hashing, state root calculation
- **Keccak-256:** Ethereum compatibility in bridge
- **SHA-256:** Legacy compatibility where required

### 1.2 Consensus Security Model

**ASF (Asynchronous Synergistic Finality) Assumptions:**
1. **Byzantine Fault Tolerance:** Up to ⅓ of validators may be Byzantine
2. **Network Assumptions:** Partially synchronous network (eventual message delivery)
3. **Liveness Requirement:** > ⅔ validators honest and online for progress
4. **Safety Requirement:** > ⅔ validators must sign for finality

**Attack Resistance:**
- **Nothing-at-Stake:** Prevented by slashing for double-signing
- **Long-Range Attack:** Mitigated by checkpointing and weak subjectivity
- **Eclipse Attack:** Prevented by peer diversity requirements
- **Sybil Attack:** Mitigated by staking requirements (minimum 10,000 ËTR)

### 1.3 Bridge Security Model

**ËDSC Bridge Assumptions:**
1. **Custodian Trust:** Initially 3-of-5 multisig (decentralization roadmap: 100+ custodians by Q4 2026)
2. **Oracle Honesty:** Price feeds assumed honest (Chainlink-based, 7/12 consensus required)
3. **Reserve Ratio:** Maintains >110% collateralization (circuit breaker at 105%)
4. **Redemption Delay:** 24-hour timelock for large redemptions (>10% of total supply)

**Known Limitations:**
- Centralized custodian set during bootstrap phase (< 6 months)
- Single oracle provider (Chainlink) - diversification planned for v1.1
- Cross-chain message replay attack prevention relies on nonce tracking

### 1.4 Smart Contract Security

**ËtwasmVM Assumptions:**
1. **Gas Metering:** Accurate metering prevents DoS
2. **Determinism:** WASM execution is deterministic across all nodes
3. **Isolation:** Contracts cannot access host system resources
4. **Storage Safety:** No storage key collisions between contracts

**Attack Mitigations:**
- **Reentrancy:** Guarded by execution locks
- **Integer Overflow:** Rust's checked arithmetic enforced
- **Stack Overflow:** Limited call depth (1024)
- **Storage Exhaustion:** Gas costs for storage prevent spam

- Chaos engineering for network resilience
- Economic attack simulations (flash loan attacks, oracle manipulation)

---

## 3. Known Limitations & Mitigations

### 3.1 Critical Path Limitations

**1. PPFA Block Sealing (95% Complete)**
```
Status: Runtime API implemented, block sealing pending
Impact: Block proposals not yet enforcing PPFA proposer authorization
Mitigation: Non-critical for testnet, 3-4 day completion timeline
Risk: LOW (testnet only, no economic impact)
```

**2. Centralized Bridge Custodians**
```
Status: 3-of-5 multisig (known addresses, manual rotation)
Impact: Central point of failure for bridge collateral
Mitigation: 24/7 monitoring, hardware security modules (HSMs), insurance fund (10% of TVL)
Timeline: Decentralization to 100+ custodians by Q4 2026
Risk: MEDIUM (mitigated by insurance + monitoring)
```

**3. Single Oracle Provider (Chainlink)**
```
Status: Chainlink only, 7/12 price feed consensus
Impact: Oracle failure = bridge halts
Mitigation: Circuit breaker triggers at anomalous price movements (>20% in 1 hour)
Timeline: Multi-oracle integration (Band Protocol, API3) in v1.1 (Q2 2026)
Risk: MEDIUM-LOW (Chainlink track record, circuit breakers)
```

### 3.2 Non-Critical Limitations

**Hard-Coded Weights:**
```
Issue: Pallet weights use placeholder values (10,000)
Impact: Transaction fees inaccurate, potential DoS via cheap operations
Mitigation: Benchmarking suite ready, production weights before mainnet
Timeline: 2 weeks before mainnet
Risk: LOW (testnet only)
```

**Missing Fuzzing Tests:**
```
Issue: No fuzzing for consensus message parsing
Impact: Potential edge case panics from malformed messages
Mitigation: Extensive property tests cover randomized inputs
Timeline: Fuzzing suite in Q1 2026
Risk: LOW (property tests provide good coverage)
```

## 5. Risk Assessment Matrix

| Component | Severity | Likelihood | Risk Score | Mitigation Status |
|-----------|----------|------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Consensus (ASF)** | CRITICAL | LOW | MEDIUM | ✅ 4/4 TODOs complete, extensive testing |
| **Bridge Custodians** | CRITICAL | MEDIUM | HIGH | ⚠️ Insurance fund, HSMs, monitoring |
| **Oracle Manipulation** | HIGH | LOW | MEDIUM | ✅ Circuit breakers, 7/12 consensus |
| **Smart Contract Reentrancy** | HIGH | LOW | MEDIUM | ✅ Execution locks, tested |
| **Network Partitions** | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | ✅ Partially synchronous model |
| **Double-Spend** | CRITICAL | LOW | MEDIUM | ✅ Finality gadget, checkpoints |
| **Key Theft (Validators)** | CRITICAL | LOW | MEDIUM | ✅ Slashing, keystore encryption |
| **DoS (Gas Metering)** | HIGH | MEDIUM | HIGH | ⏱️ Benchmarking pending |
| **Storage Exhaustion** | MEDIUM | LOW | LOW | ✅ Gas costs enforced |
| **Replay Attacks (Bridge)** | HIGH | MEDIUM | HIGH | ✅ Nonce tracking, signature hashes |

**Overall Risk Profile:** MEDIUM (acceptable for testnet, HIGH items require resolution before mainnet)

### 5.1 High-Priority Risks

**1. Bridge Custodian Centralization (Risk Score: HIGH)**
```
Attack Vector: Compromise 3/5 custodian keys → drain bridge collateral
Mitigation:
  - Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) for key storage
  - Geographic distribution (US, EU, Asia)
  - 24/7 monitoring with automated alerts
  - Insurance fund (10% of TVL = $1M at $10M TVL)
  - Emergency pause mechanism (governance-controlled)
Residual Risk: MEDIUM (acceptable for initial launch, decentralization roadmap mitigates)
```

**2. DoS via Cheap Transactions (Risk Score: HIGH)**
```
Attack Vector: Flood network with low-cost transactions using placeholder weights
Mitigation:
  - Benchmarking suite ready (2 weeks to production weights)
  - Transaction priority queue (honest users can pay premium)
  - Rate limiting per sender (10 tx/block maximum)
Residual Risk: LOW (resolved before mainnet)
```

**3. Replay Attacks on Bridge (Risk Score: HIGH)**
```
Attack Vector: Reuse valid signature on different chain or after nonce reset
Mitigation:
  - ChainID included in signature message
  - Nonce tracking in storage (UsedSignatures map)
  - Block number expiry (signatures valid for 100 blocks = ~10 minutes)
Residual Risk: LOW (comprehensive replay prevention)
```

## 7. Audit Methodology Recommendations

### 7.1 Static Analysis

**Recommended Tools:**
1. **Clippy (Rust linter)** - Already integrated ✅
2. **cargo-audit** - Dependency vulnerability scanning ✅
3. **cargo-geiger** - Unsafe code detection (run: `cargo install cargo-geiger && cargo geiger`)
4. **semgrep** - Custom rule scanning for common patterns

**Commands to Run:**
```bash
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo audit
cargo geiger
```

### 7.2 Dynamic Analysis

**Recommended Approaches:**
1. **Fuzzing:** Use cargo-fuzz on consensus message parsing
2. **Property Testing:** Review existing 57 property tests, extend if needed
3. **Stress Testing:** Run nodes under load (1000 tx/s for 72 hours)
4. **Network Simulation:** Use `simnet` to simulate Byzantine nodes

### 7.3 Manual Review Focus Areas

**High-Priority Functions (see Section 6):**
- All signature verification logic
- Arithmetic operations (overflow/underflow)
- State transitions in consensus
- Storage access patterns (check for TOCTOU)

**Low-Priority but Worth Reviewing:**
- Configuration parameter validation
- Error message contents (information leakage)
- Logging statements (sensitive data exposure)
