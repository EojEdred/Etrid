# Deployment Options Summary - START HERE

**Date:** October 29, 2025
**Status:** Ready to deploy 21 validators

---

## Quick Answer

**Azure is unreliable → Use hybrid multi-provider approach**

**Recommended:** Mix of Hetzner (cheap) + Vultr (global) + DigitalOcean (reliable) + Akash (decentralized)

**Cost:** $802/month vs $2,100/month Azure = **Save $15,576/year**

---

## Three Ways to Deploy

### Option 1: Automated Scripts (FAST) ⭐ RECOMMENDED

**What:** Run one command, deploy all 21 validators in 1 hour

**How:**
```bash
cd /Users/macbook/Desktop/etrid/scripts
./deploy-hybrid-multi-provider.sh
```

**Requires:**
- Provider CLIs installed (Hetzner, Vultr, DigitalOcean)
- API tokens from each provider
- 1 hour of time

**Pros:**
- ✅ Fastest (1 hour vs 6 hours manual)
- ✅ Reproducible (can redeploy easily)
- ✅ Less error-prone
- ✅ Automated inventory creation

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Requires command-line comfort
- ⚠️ Need to get API tokens from 3-4 providers
- ⚠️ Bare metal still requires manual order

**Best for:** If you're comfortable with terminal

---

### Option 2: Manual UI-Based (BEGINNER-FRIENDLY)

**What:** Click through each provider's website, create VMs one by one

**How:**
1. Go to Hetzner.com → Order 3 bare metal + 10 VPS
2. Go to Vultr.com → Create 4 VPS
3. Go to DigitalOcean.com → Create 3 droplets
4. Go to Akash → Deploy 1 container

**Time:** 4-6 hours (lots of clicking and waiting)

**Pros:**
- ✅ No command line needed
- ✅ See everything visually
- ✅ Full control over each setting
- ✅ Good for learning

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Slow (4-6 hours vs 1 hour)
- ⚠️ Error-prone (easy to mis-configure)
- ⚠️ Hard to reproduce
- ⚠️ Need to track 21 IPs manually

**Best for:** If you're new to servers or want to learn

---

### Option 3: Hybrid (PRACTICAL) ⭐⭐ BEST FOR YOU

**What:** Automate what you can, manual for what you can't

**How:**

**Step 1 (Manual - 30 min):**
- Order 3 Hetzner bare metal servers (can't automate)
- Wait 2-24 hours for delivery

**Step 2 (Automated - 10 min):**
```bash
./deploy-hybrid-multi-provider.sh
```
- Deploys 10 Hetzner VPS
- Deploys 4 Vultr VPS
- Deploys 3 DigitalOcean droplets

**Step 3 (Manual - 30 min):**
- Deploy 1 Akash validator (requires learning Akash)

**Step 4 (Automated - 20 min):**
```bash
./deploy-validator-software.sh
```
- Uploads binary to all 21 VMs
- Inserts keys
- Starts validators

**Total time:** 2-3 hours active work + 2-24 hours waiting for bare metal

**Best for:** Most people (including you!)

- **Why:** Censorship-resistant, supports Web3
- **Location:** Distributed

**Total: $869/month = $10,428/year**
**vs Azure: $2,100/month = Save $14,772/year**

## Step-by-Step: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)

### Phase 1: Get API Keys (20 min)

**Hetzner:**
1. Go to: https://console.hetzner.cloud/
2. Create project: "Etrid Validators"
3. Go to: Security → API Tokens
4. Generate new token
5. Copy token (save in password manager)

**Vultr:**
1. Go to: https://my.vultr.com/settings/#settingsapi
2. Enable API
3. Generate API Key
4. Copy key (save in password manager)

**DigitalOcean:**
1. Go to: https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/api/tokens
2. Generate New Token
3. Name: "etrid-validators"
4. Read & Write permissions
5. Copy token (save in password manager)

---

### Phase 2: Install CLIs (10 min)

```bash
# Hetzner
brew install hcloud

# Vultr
brew install vultr/vultr-cli/vultr-cli

# DigitalOcean
brew install doctl

# Authenticate each
hcloud context create etrid-project  # Paste Hetzner token
export VULTR_API_KEY=your_vultr_key
doctl auth init  # Paste DO token
```

---

### Phase 3: Order Bare Metal (30 min + wait)

**Why manual:** Hetzner doesn't allow bare metal via API (fraud prevention)

1. Go to: https://robot.hetzner.com/order/index
2. Filter: **Dedicated Root Server** → **AMD Ryzen**
3. Select: **AX41-NVMe** (€46.41/month)
   - CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 3600 (6 cores @ 3.6 GHz)
   - RAM: 64 GB DDR4
   - Storage: 2×512 GB NVMe RAID
4. Quantity: **3**
5. Location: Falkenstein (FSN1) or Helsinki (HEL1)
6. OS: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
7. SSH Key: Paste `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`
8. Names:
   - `gizzi-bootstrap-1`
   - `eojedred-bootstrap-2`
   - `governance-validator-03`
9. Complete order
10. **Wait 2-24 hours** for activation email

**Cost:** $150/month total

---

### Phase 4: Deploy VPS via Script (10 min)

```bash
cd /Users/macbook/Desktop/etrid/scripts

# Make executable
chmod +x deploy-hybrid-multi-provider.sh

# Run deployment
./deploy-hybrid-multi-provider.sh
```

**What happens:**
1. Creates 10 Hetzner CPX31 VPS (auto)
2. Creates 4 Vultr High Frequency VPS (auto)
3. Creates 3 DigitalOcean droplets (auto)
4. Generates `validator-inventory.txt` with all IPs

**Wait:** 5-10 minutes for all VMs to provision

---

### Phase 5: Deploy to Akash (Optional, 30 min)

**If you want the 21st validator decentralized:**

1. Install Akash CLI: `brew install akash`
2. Create wallet: `akash keys add wallet`
3. Fund with ~50 AKT ($20-30)
4. Deploy using provided manifest

**Or skip Akash and deploy 21st validator to Hetzner for simplicity**

---

### Phase 6: Deploy Validator Software (Auto, 20 min)

**After all VMs are ready (including bare metal):**

I'll create this script next, but it will:

1. Upload `flarechain-node` binary to all 21 VMs
2. Extract validator keys from `validator-keys-complete.json`
3. Insert keys into each validator
4. Create systemd services
5. Start all validators
6. Verify committee formation

---

- ✅ 21 validators running across 4 providers
- ✅ Geographic distribution (EU, US, Asia)
- ✅ No single point of failure
- ✅ $14,772/year savings vs Azure

## My Recommendation

**For you (Eoj):**

1. **Today:** Order 3 Hetzner bare metal servers (30 min)
2. **Tomorrow:** While waiting, get API keys from Vultr, DO, Hetzner Cloud
3. **When bare metal arrives:** Run automated deployment script (1 hour)
4. **Result:** All 21 validators running in 2-3 days total

**Cost:** $869/month (vs $2,100 Azure)
**Reliability:** Better (multi-provider redundancy)
**Time:** 2-3 hours active work
