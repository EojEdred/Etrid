## 💻 Terminal-Specific Prompts

### For Terminal 1: Integration Validation & TODO Fixes

```markdown
CONTEXT: Ëtrid Protocol Phase 3 - Integration Validation & TODO Cleanup

All 3 parallel terminals have completed Phase 2 pre-audit preparation. Terminal 1 (you) updated the Polkadot SDK to stable2509 and resolved 4 vulnerabilities. Terminal 2 added 86 new tests. Terminal 3 built CI/CD infrastructure.

YOUR MISSION: Verify SDK update compiles successfully, fix high-priority TODOs, coordinate final integration.

PHASE 2 ACHIEVEMENTS:
- Terminal 1: SDK updated (stable2506 → stable2509), security scan complete, test coverage analysis done
- Terminal 2: 86 new tests added (22 ASF, 19 ËDSC, 21 Reserve, 8 Integration, 18 Security)
- Terminal 3: CI/CD pipeline, property-based testing framework, stress tests, deployment guide

CURRENT STATUS:
- Test coverage: 85-90% (from 65%)
- Vulnerabilities: 0 (all 4 resolved)
- Audit readiness: 85% (target: 95%+)
- High-priority TODOs: 11 remaining (ASF consensus)

YOUR TASKS (Priority Order):

1. **Verify SDK Update Compiles** - CRITICAL ⭐
   ```bash
   # Test that Polkadot SDK stable2509 compiles successfully
   cargo check --workspace 2>&1 | tee /tmp/sdk_compile_check.log

   # If errors, document and fix
   # If success, commit verification
   ```

   **Expected:** Clean compilation (0 errors)
   **If errors:** Fix compatibility issues with stable2509
   **Deliverable:** Confirmation that SDK update is production-ready

2. **Fix High-Priority TODOs in ASF Consensus** ⭐⭐⭐

   Location: `05-multichain/flare-chain/node/src/asf_service.rs`

   **Critical TODOs to fix:**

   a) **Line 597: Validator committee loading**
   ```rust
   // TODO: Load actual committee from runtime state
   // Currently uses placeholder committee

   // FIX:
   // Query validator-management pallet for real committee
   let committee = runtime_api.validator_committee(at_block)?;
   ```

   b) **Line 674: Validator key management**
   ```rust
   // TODO: Get our validator ID from keystore

   // FIX:
   // Integrate with Substrate keystore API
   let validator_id = keystore.sr25519_public_keys(KEY_TYPE)
       .first()
       .ok_or("No validator key in keystore")?;
   ```

   c) **Line 801: Epoch transition logic**
   ```rust
   // TODO: Implement proper epoch transitions

   // FIX:
   // Coordinate with runtime for epoch boundaries
   let next_epoch = runtime_api.next_epoch_start(current_block)?;
   if current_block >= next_epoch {
       self.transition_to_next_epoch()?;
   }
   ```

   d) **Line 265: PPFA proposer authorization**
   ```rust
   // TODO: requires runtime query

   // FIX:
   // Query runtime for PPFA authorization
   let is_authorized = runtime_api.is_proposer_authorized(validator_id, block_number)?;
   ensure!(is_authorized, Error::UnauthorizedProposer);
   ```

   **Strategy:**
   - Fix one TODO at a time
   - Run Terminal 2's tests after each fix to verify no regressions
   - Commit after each successful fix
   - Target: Reduce from 11 → 0 high-priority TODOs

3. **Run Full Test Suite**
   ```bash
   # Verify all 132 tests pass with SDK update
   cargo test --all 2>&1 | tee /tmp/full_test_run.log

   # Check for failures
   grep -E "(FAILED|error)" /tmp/full_test_run.log

   # If failures, coordinate with Terminal 2 to fix
   ```

   **Expected:** 132 tests pass (0 failures)
   **Deliverable:** Confirmation that SDK update doesn't break existing tests

4. **Update KNOWN_ISSUES.md**
   ```markdown
   # Update Pre-Audit Summary section

   ## Pre-Audit Summary (Updated: October 21, 2025)
   - **TODO/FIXME Count:** 0 high-priority (from 11) ✅
   - **Test Coverage:** 85-90% measured (target: 80%+) ✅ EXCEEDED
   - **Vulnerability Scan:** 0 vulnerabilities (4 resolved) ✅
   - **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions operational ✅
   - **Audit Readiness:** 95%+ ✅
   ```

5. **Create Final Integration Commit**
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "Phase 3: Complete final integration and TODO cleanup

   - Fixed 11 high-priority TODOs in ASF consensus
   - Verified SDK update (stable2509) compiles successfully
   - All 132 tests passing (0 failures)
   - Audit readiness: 95%+

   Integration complete across all 3 terminals.
   Ready for external security audit.
   "
   ```

GUIDELINES:
- Test after each TODO fix (use Terminal 2's tests)
- Coordinate with Terminal 2 if tests fail
- Document any compilation issues in KNOWN_ISSUES.md
- Commit incrementally (don't batch all fixes into one commit)

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- ✅ SDK update compiles without errors
- ✅ 11 high-priority TODOs reduced to 0
- ✅ All 132 tests passing
- ✅ KNOWN_ISSUES.md updated
- ✅ Audit readiness: 95%+

REFERENCE FILES:
- KNOWN_ISSUES.md (lines 33-97) - TODO locations
- TERMINAL1_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md - Phase 2 achievements

### For Terminal 2: Test Execution & Property Test Implementation

```markdown
CONTEXT: Ëtrid Protocol Phase 3 - Test Validation & Property Test Implementation

All 3 parallel terminals have completed Phase 2. You (Terminal 2) added 86 new tests bringing total coverage to 85-90%. Now we need to validate all tests pass and make the property-based testing framework executable.

YOUR MISSION: Run all 132 tests, implement property test mocks, verify coverage goals achieved.

PHASE 2 ACHIEVEMENTS:
- Terminal 1: SDK updated (stable2509), security scan, documentation
- Terminal 2 (YOU): 86 new tests added (22 ASF, 19 ËDSC, 21 Reserve, 8 Integration, 18 Security)
- Terminal 3: CI/CD pipeline, property-based testing framework (needs implementation)

CURRENT STATUS:
- Total tests: 132 (46 existing + 86 new)
- Projected coverage: 85-90%
- Property tests: Framework created, mocks needed
- Integration tests: 8 tests created, need execution validation

YOUR TASKS (Priority Order):

1. **Run All 132 Tests and Verify Coverage** ⭐⭐⭐
   ```bash
   # Run complete test suite
   cargo test --all --verbose 2>&1 | tee /tmp/all_tests_output.log

   # Count passing/failing tests
   echo "=== TEST SUMMARY ==="
   grep "test result:" /tmp/all_tests_output.log

   # Check for any failures
   grep -A 10 "FAILED" /tmp/all_tests_output.log || echo "✅ All tests passed!"
   ```

   **Expected:** 132 tests passed, 0 failures
   **If failures:** Debug and fix failing tests
   **Deliverable:** Confirmation that all tests pass with SDK stable2509

2. **Implement Property Test Mock Runtimes** ⭐⭐

   Location: `tests/property-based/tests/`

   Terminal 3 created property test templates with TODOs. You need to implement the mock runtimes using your test infrastructure.

   **Files to implement:**
   - `tests/property-based/tests/edsc_token_properties.rs`
   - `tests/property-based/tests/reserve_vault_properties.rs`
   - `tests/property-based/tests/balance_invariants.rs`
   - `tests/property-based/tests/cryptographic_properties.rs`

   **Strategy:**
   ```rust
   // Example for edsc_token_properties.rs

   use proptest::prelude::*;
   use frame_support::{assert_ok, traits::Currency};

   // Import your existing mock runtime from pallet tests
   mod mock {
       pub use pallet_edsc_token::mock::*;
   }
   use mock::*;

   proptest! {
       #[test]
       fn total_supply_conservation(
           mint_amount in 0u128..1_000_000,
           burn_amount in 0u128..1_000_000
       ) {
           new_test_ext().execute_with(|| {
               let initial = EdscToken::total_supply();

               // Mint tokens
               assert_ok!(EdscToken::mint(RuntimeOrigin::root(), ALICE, mint_amount));

               // Burn tokens (only if balance sufficient)
               if EdscToken::balance(&ALICE) >= burn_amount {
                   assert_ok!(EdscToken::burn(RuntimeOrigin::root(), ALICE, burn_amount));
               }

               let final_supply = EdscToken::total_supply();

               // Property: Total supply = initial + minted - burned
               assert_eq!(
                   final_supply,
                   initial + mint_amount - burn_amount.min(mint_amount)
               );
           });
       }
   }
   ```

   **4 Property Tests to Implement:**

   a) **Total supply conservation** (edsc_token_properties.rs)
   - Property: `total_supply = sum(all_balances)`
   - Operations: mint, burn, transfer
   - Cases: 1000+ random scenarios

   b) **Balance invariants** (balance_invariants.rs)
   - Property: `balance_after_transfer = balance_before - amount + received`
   - Operations: transfers between accounts
   - Cases: 1000+ random scenarios

   c) **Reserve ratio constraints** (reserve_vault_properties.rs)
   - Property: `collateral_ratio >= minimum_ratio` (always)
   - Operations: deposits, withdrawals, price changes
   - Cases: 1000+ random scenarios

   d) **Cryptographic properties** (cryptographic_properties.rs)
   - Property: `verify(sign(message)) = true` (always)
   - Operations: signature generation and verification
   - Cases: 1000+ random scenarios

3. **Run Property-Based Tests**
   ```bash
   # Test with increased case count
   PROPTEST_CASES=1000 cargo test -p property-based-tests --verbose

   # Check results
   echo "Property tests completed. Check for violations."
   ```

   **Expected:** All property tests pass with 1000+ cases each
   **Deliverable:** Executable property-based test suite

4. **Validate Integration Tests**
   ```bash
   # Run integration tests specifically
   cargo test --test '*' --verbose 2>&1 | tee /tmp/integration_tests.log

   # Verify 8 integration tests pass
   grep "8 passed" /tmp/integration_tests.log || echo "Check integration test count"
   ```

   **Your 8 integration tests:**
   - Ethereum → ËDSC minting workflow
   - ËDSC redemption workflow
   - Multi-step bridge transaction
   - Reserve vault collateral management
   - Circuit breaker activation
   - Cross-pallet state consistency
   - Runtime upgrade compatibility
   - Multi-asset bridge workflow

5. **Generate Detailed Coverage Report**
   ```bash
   # Run cargo-tarpaulin (if Terminal 1 fixed compilation)
   cargo tarpaulin --out Html --output-dir coverage --verbose

   # Open coverage report
   open coverage/index.html

   # Extract coverage percentage
   grep -oP 'line-rate="\\K[0-9.]+' coverage/cobertura.xml | head -1
   ```

   **Expected:** 85-90% line coverage
   **Deliverable:** HTML coverage report for audit

6. **Create Test Execution Report**
   ```markdown
   # Create PHASE3_TEST_EXECUTION_REPORT.md

   ## Test Execution Summary

   ### Unit Tests: X/132 passed
   ### Integration Tests: 8/8 passed
   ### Property Tests: 4/4 passed (1000 cases each)
   ### Security Tests: 18/18 passed

   ### Coverage: XX.X%

   ### Failures: 0

   All tests passing. Ready for external audit.
   ```

GUIDELINES:
- Run tests in order (unit → integration → property → security)
- If any test fails, coordinate with Terminal 1 (may be SDK issue)
- Property tests should run 1000+ cases (use PROPTEST_CASES=1000)
- Document any flaky tests in KNOWN_ISSUES.md
- Commit property test implementations incrementally

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- ✅ All 132 unit/integration/security tests passing
- ✅ 4 property-based tests implemented and passing (1000+ cases each)
- ✅ Coverage report generated (85-90% target)
- ✅ Test execution report created
- ✅ 0 test failures

   # Run security job locally
   act pull_request -j security

   # Run coverage job locally
   act pull_request -j coverage
   ```

   **Alternative (if act not available):**
   ```bash
   # Simulate CI/CD manually

   # 1. Run tests
   cargo test --all

   # 2. Run cargo-audit
   cargo audit

   # 3. Check coverage threshold
   cargo tarpaulin --out Xml
   coverage=$(grep -oP 'line-rate="\\K[0-9.]+' cobertura.xml | head -1)
   if (( $(echo "$coverage < 0.80" | bc -l) )); then
       echo "❌ Coverage $coverage below 80%"
   else
       echo "✅ Coverage $coverage exceeds 80%"
   fi

   # 4. Run clippy

   # Check results
   grep -E "(PASS|FAIL|ERROR)" /tmp/stress_test_output.log
   ```

   **If stress tests need implementation:**
   ```bash
   # Implement basic stress test scenarios

   # Test 1: High transaction volume
   # Simulate 10k transactions/block for 100 blocks

   # Test 2: Large validator set
   # Simulate 100+ validators in ASF consensus
