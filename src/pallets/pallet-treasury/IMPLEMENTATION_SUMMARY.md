# Pallet Treasury Implementation Summary

## Overview

Complete implementation of `pallet-treasury` for Ëtrid protocol fund management, based on specifications from Ivory Papers Volume III.

## Created Files

### 1. `/Users/macbook/Desktop/etrid/src/pallets/pallet-treasury/Cargo.toml`
- Standard Substrate pallet dependencies
- Compatible with polkadot-v1.0.0 branch
- Includes frame-support, frame-system, sp-runtime
- Features: std, runtime-benchmarks, try-runtime

### 2. `/Users/macbook/Desktop/etrid/src/pallets/pallet-treasury/src/lib.rs` (907 lines)
Complete pallet implementation with:

#### Core Types
- `BudgetCategory`: Development, Marketing, Operations, Grants, EmergencyReserve
- `FundingSource`: TransactionFees, ConsensusDayMinting, ValidatorSlashing, CrossChainFees, Other
- `DisbursementStatus`: Pending, Executed, Rejected
- `Disbursement<T>`: Full proposal details with approvals tracking

- `EmergencyWithdrawal(amount, recipient, approvals)`
- `BudgetAllocationsUpdated(allocations)`
- `DirectorAdded/Removed(account)`
- `CategoryAllocationIncreased(category, amount)`

#### Errors
- `NotDirector` - Caller not a registered director
- `DisbursementNotFound` - Invalid ID
- `AlreadyApproved` - Director already approved
- `InsufficientCategoryAllocation` - Budget exceeded
- `InsufficientTreasuryBalance` - Vault insufficient
- `InvalidBudgetAllocations` - Percentages don't sum to 100%
- `AlreadyExecuted` - Proposal already processed
- `EmergencyThresholdNotMet` - Need 7/9 for emergency
- `ApprovalThresholdNotMet` - Need 6/9 for normal
- `DisbursementExpired` - Proposal expired (7 days)
- Plus 6 more validation errors

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Multisig Governance
- 9 Directors control treasury
- 6-of-9 approval threshold for normal disbursements
- 7-of-9 approval threshold for emergency withdrawals
- Auto-execution when threshold reached
- Proposal expiration (7 days default)

### 2. Budget Management
- Default allocations: Development (40%), Marketing (20%), Operations (15%), Grants (15%), Emergency (10%)
- Category-specific budgets enforced
- Consensus Day integration for budget updates
- Emergency reserve locked separately

### 3. Funding Sources
- Transaction fees: 50% → Treasury, 50% burned
- Consensus Day minting: Approved budgets sent to treasury
- Validator slashing: 50% → Treasury, 50% burned
- Cross-chain fees: 10% → Treasury
- Historical tracking per source

### 4. Security Features
- Multisig protection on all disbursements
- Higher threshold for emergency access
- Category budget limits enforced
- Proposal expiration prevents stale approvals
- Audit trail for all transactions

### 5. Integration Points
- `pallet-consensus-day`: Receives minting, allocates budgets
- `pallet-validator-rewards`: Receives slashing proceeds
- Transaction fee handler: Receives 50% of fees
- Bridge pallets: Receives 10% of cross-chain fees
- `pallet-multiasset-reserve`: EDSC stablecoin management

## Default Budget Allocations (from Ivory Papers)

| Category | Percentage | Basis Points | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|--------------|---------|
| Development | 40% | 4000 | Core protocol, research, infrastructure |
| Marketing | 20% | 2000 | Community growth, partnerships |
| Operations | 15% | 1500 | Salaries, legal, administrative |
| Grants | 15% | 1500 | Ecosystem grants, bounties |
| Emergency Reserve | 10% | 1000 | Critical protocol emergencies |

## Workflow Example

### Normal Disbursement
1. Director proposes: `propose_disbursement(Development, recipient, 1M ËTR, "Q1 dev")`
2. Creates disbursement ID #42
3. Proposer auto-approves (1/6)
4. 5 other directors approve: `approve_disbursement(42)`
5. When 6th approval received, auto-executes
6. Funds transferred to recipient
7. Development category allocation decreased by 1M ËTR

### Emergency Withdrawal
1. Director proposes: `emergency_withdrawal(recipient, 500K ËTR, "Security patch")`
2. Creates emergency disbursement (requires 7/9)
3. Proposer auto-approves (1/7)
4. 6 other directors approve
5. When 7th approval received, auto-executes
6. Funds withdrawn from Emergency Reserve
7. Emergency reserve balance decreased

## Configuration Constants

```rust
pub const TreasuryDirectorCount: u8 = 9;
pub const TreasuryApprovalThreshold: u8 = 6;
pub const TreasuryEmergencyThreshold: u8 = 7;
pub const TreasuryProposalExpiration: BlockNumber = 7 * DAYS;
```

## PalletId

**Treasury Vault**: `py/trsry`

This generates a deterministic account address for the treasury vault.

## Next Steps

### 1. Add to Runtime
- Update `runtime/Cargo.toml`
- Configure in `runtime/lib.rs`
- Add to `construct_runtime!` macro

### 2. Configure Genesis
- Set initial 9 directors
- Configure budget allocations
- Add to chain spec

### 3. Integrate with Other Pallets
- Connect transaction fee handler
- Integrate with pallet-consensus-day
- Connect pallet-validator-rewards slashing
- Integrate bridge fee routing

### 4. Set Up Directors
- Generate 9 director accounts (secure key management)
- Distribute keys to founding directors
- Document multisig procedures

### 5. Testing
- Unit tests for all extrinsics
- Integration tests with other pallets
- Test multisig approval workflow
- Test emergency withdrawal
- Test budget allocation enforcement

### 6. Monitoring
- Set up balance monitoring
- Track funding sources
- Monitor disbursements
- Alert on large withdrawals
