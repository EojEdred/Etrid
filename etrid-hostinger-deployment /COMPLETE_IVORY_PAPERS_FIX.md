# üîß COMPLETE FIX: Ivory Papers "Loading content..." Issue

## üéØ YOUR SITUATION

- ‚úÖ File works when you open it locally from your computer
- ‚ùå File shows "Loading content..." when uploaded to Hostinger
- ‚úÖ You've uploaded the 219 KB file and force-refreshed browser
- ‚ùå Still doesn't work

This means **the file IS correct**, but something is wrong with the upload or server.

---

## üìã STEP-BY-STEP FIX (Follow in Order)

### STEP 1: Upload the Simple Test File

**Purpose:** Verify that basic JavaScript works on your Hostinger server.

**File to upload:**
```
From: /Users/macbook/Desktop/etrid/etrid-hostinger-deployment /website/whitepaper/test-simple.html
To: Your Hostinger whitepaper folder
```

**What to do:**
1. Log into Hostinger File Manager
2. Navigate to your `whitepaper` folder (or `public_html/whitepaper`)
3. Upload `test-simple.html`
4. Visit: `http://yourdomain.com/whitepaper/test-simple.html`

**What you should see:**
- ‚úÖ **If you see "SUCCESS! JavaScript is working!"** ‚Üí Continue to STEP 2
- ‚ùå **If you see "Loading content..."** ‚Üí JavaScript is completely broken on your server. Contact Hostinger support - this is a server configuration issue.

---

### STEP 2: Check File Size on Hostinger

**Purpose:** Verify the file didn't get corrupted during upload.

**What to do:**
1. In Hostinger File Manager
2. Find `viewer-standalone.html` in your whitepaper folder
3. Right-click the file ‚Üí Properties (or Details)
4. Look at the file size

**What you should see:**
- ‚úÖ **File size is 224,407 bytes (or "219 KB")** ‚Üí File uploaded correctly, continue to STEP 3
- ‚ùå **File size is different (like 171,000 bytes or "171 KB")** ‚Üí Wrong file uploaded! Go to STEP 2A

#### STEP 2A: Re-Upload the Correct File

**The correct file is here:**
```
/Users/macbook/Desktop/etrid/etrid-hostinger-deployment /whitepaper 2/viewer-standalone.html

Size: 224,407 bytes (219 KB)
```

**How to upload correctly:**

**Option A: Using Hostinger File Manager**
1. Delete the old `viewer-standalone.html` from your whitepaper folder
2. Click "Upload" button
3. Select the file from `/whitepaper 2/viewer-standalone.html`
4. Wait for upload to complete (do NOT interrupt)
5. After upload, check file size again (should be 224,407 bytes)
6. Go back to STEP 1 and test again

**Option B: Using FTP Client (FileZilla/Cyberduck)**
1. Connect to your Hostinger account via FTP
2. **IMPORTANT:** Set transfer mode to **BINARY** (NOT ASCII/TEXT)
   - In FileZilla: Transfer menu ‚Üí Transfer type ‚Üí Binary
3. Delete the old `viewer-standalone.html`
4. Upload the new one from `/whitepaper 2/viewer-standalone.html`
5. Verify file size is 224,407 bytes
6. Go back to STEP 1 and test again

### STEP 3: Clear ALL Caches

**Purpose:** Make sure you're not looking at an old cached version.

**What to do:**

1. **Clear browser cache:**
   - **Mac:** Press `Cmd + Shift + R` (force reload)
   - **Windows:** Press `Ctrl + F5`
   - Or go to browser settings and clear cache for the last hour

2. **Try incognito/private window:**
   - **Chrome:** Cmd+Shift+N (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+N (Windows)
   - **Firefox:** Cmd+Shift+P (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows)
   - **Safari:** Cmd+Shift+N

3. **Visit the viewer:**
   - Go to: `http://yourdomain.com/whitepaper/viewer-standalone.html`

**What you should see:**
- ‚úÖ **Ivory Papers loads with 4 volume buttons** ‚Üí SUCCESS! It's fixed!
- ‚ùå **Still shows "Loading content..."** ‚Üí Continue to STEP 4

---

### STEP 4: Check Browser Console for Errors

**Purpose:** See what error JavaScript is throwing.

**What to do:**
1. Visit `viewer-standalone.html` on Hostinger
2. Press **F12** (or Cmd+Option+J on Mac)
3. Click the **Console** tab
4. Look for RED error messages

**Common errors and fixes:**

#### Error: "marked is not defined"
**What this means:** The embedded marked.js library didn't load.

**How to fix:**
1. The file got corrupted during upload
2. Go back to STEP 2A and re-upload using FTP in BINARY mode
3. TEXT/ASCII mode corrupts JavaScript - must use BINARY

#### Error: "Failed to load resource" or "404 Not Found"
**What this means:** The file is in the wrong directory.

**How to fix:**
1. Check the exact URL you're visiting
2. Make sure the file is in the correct folder on Hostinger
3. Common locations:
   - `public_html/whitepaper/viewer-standalone.html`
   - `www/whitepaper/viewer-standalone.html`

#### Error: "Content Security Policy" or "CSP"
**What this means:** Hostinger is blocking inline JavaScript.

**How to fix:**
1. This is rare but possible on shared hosting
2. You need to contact Hostinger support
3. Ask them to check Content Security Policy settings for your domain

#### No errors in console, but still shows "Loading content..."
**What this means:** JavaScript is running but something is stuck.

**How to fix:**
1. Upload the debug version: `viewer-standalone-debug.html`
2. Visit it in browser
3. Check console - it will show detailed debugging info
4. Screenshot the console and you'll see exactly where it's stuck

---

### STEP 5: Upload Diagnostic File (If Still Not Working)

**Purpose:** Get detailed technical information about what's failing.

**File to upload:**
```
From: /Users/macbook/Desktop/etrid/etrid-hostinger-deployment /website/whitepaper/diagnostic.html
To: Your Hostinger whitepaper folder
```

**What to do:**
1. Upload `diagnostic.html` to your whitepaper folder
2. Visit: `http://yourdomain.com/whitepaper/diagnostic.html`
3. Take a screenshot of what it shows
4. This will show:
   - ‚úì or ‚úó JavaScript is running
   - ‚úì or ‚úó marked library is loaded
   - ‚úì or ‚úó DOM is accessible

**What the results mean:**

- ‚úì JavaScript is running, ‚úó marked library NOT loaded ‚Üí **File corrupted during upload** ‚Üí Re-upload in BINARY mode
- ‚úì JavaScript is running, ‚úì marked library loaded ‚Üí **Viewer file has a different problem** ‚Üí Upload viewer-standalone-debug.html
- ‚úó JavaScript is NOT running ‚Üí **Hostinger configuration problem** ‚Üí Contact Hostinger support

## üö® MOST LIKELY CAUSES (In Order of Probability)

### 1. File Uploaded in TEXT Mode Instead of BINARY Mode (80% probability)
When you upload a file via FTP in TEXT/ASCII mode, it corrupts JavaScript by changing line endings. This makes the embedded marked.js library fail.

**FIX:** Re-upload using FTP client with BINARY mode enabled.

### 2. Wrong File Uploaded (15% probability)
You might have multiple versions of `viewer-standalone.html` on your computer. Only the 219 KB (224,407 bytes) version has the embedded library.

**FIX:** Make sure you're uploading from `/whitepaper 2/viewer-standalone.html` which is 224,407 bytes.

### 3. Browser Cache (4% probability)
Your browser is showing an old cached version.

**FIX:** Clear cache, try incognito window, try different browser.

### 4. Hostinger Server Configuration (1% probability)
Some shared hosting providers block inline JavaScript or have restrictive Content Security Policies.

**FIX:** Contact Hostinger support.

## üí° PRO TIP: One-Command Test (If You Have SFTP Access)

If you have command-line access or terminal:

```bash
# From your Mac, upload everything at once:
cd "/Users/macbook/Desktop/etrid/etrid-hostinger-deployment /whitepaper 2"

# Upload via SFTP (replace with your Hostinger details):
sftp your_username@your_domain.com

# Once connected:
cd public_html/whitepaper
put viewer-standalone.html
put ../website/whitepaper/test-simple.html
put ../website/whitepaper/diagnostic.html
quit
```

Then test in this order:
1. test-simple.html
2. diagnostic.html
3. viewer-standalone.html
