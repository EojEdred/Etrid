# 📖 READ ME FIRST - Ivory Papers Fix

## ✅ I Found the Problem!

I checked your live website at **https://etrid.org/whitepaper/viewer-standalone.html**

**The issue:** Your file was **cut off during upload**. The Hostinger File Manager couldn't handle the 219 KB file size and only uploaded part of it.

**Result:** The marked.js library IS there, but the JavaScript code that uses it got cut off at the end.

**The fix:** Re-upload via FTP (File Transfer Protocol) instead of the web-based File Manager.
