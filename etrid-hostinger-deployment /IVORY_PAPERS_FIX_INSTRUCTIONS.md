# 🔧 FIX: Ivory Papers "Loading content..." Issue

## ✅ The Problem
The viewer shows "Loading content..." and never loads the papers.

## ✅ The Solution

### Step 1: Test if JavaScript is working

1. Upload the test file first: `whitepaper/test-simple.html`
2. Visit: `https://yourdomain.com/whitepaper/test-simple.html`
3. **If you see "SUCCESS! JavaScript is working!"** → JavaScript works, continue to Step 2
4. **If you see "Loading content..."** → JavaScript is broken, check browser console for errors

### Step 2: Upload the correct viewer file

The correct file with embedded marked.js is:
```
/Users/macbook/Desktop/etrid/etrid-hostinger-deployment /website/whitepaper/viewer-standalone.html
```

**File size:** ~219 KB (224,133 bytes)
**Lines:** 5,359 lines

Upload this file to replace the old one.

### Step 3: Clear browser cache

After uploading, **force refresh** your browser:
- **Chrome/Firefox (Mac):** Cmd + Shift + R
- **Chrome/Firefox (Windows):** Ctrl + F5
- **Safari:** Cmd + Option + R

### Step 4: Check if it works

Visit: `https://yourdomain.com/whitepaper/viewer-standalone.html`

You should now see the Ivory Papers content.
