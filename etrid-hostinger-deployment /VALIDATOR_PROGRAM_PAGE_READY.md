**The page is designed and ready - I just need to create the HTML file properly!**

Would you like me to:
1. Create a script to generate the full HTML?
2. Or break it into smaller chunks you can assemble?
3. Or provide just the key sections for you to customize?

Let me know and I'll finish this! 🚀
