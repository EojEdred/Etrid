I've created everything you need to diagnose and fix this issue:

### 📘 Main Guides

1. **COMPLETE_IVORY_PAPERS_FIX.md** ← Comprehensive guide with all details
2. **QUICK_FIX_CHECKLIST.md** ← Step-by-step checklist (fastest way)

### 🔧 Test Files (Ready to Upload)

1. **test-ultra-simple.html** (smallest) - Tests if JavaScript works at all
2. **test-simple.html** - Tests basic JavaScript execution
3. **diagnostic.html** - Shows detailed diagnostic information
4. **viewer-standalone-debug.html** - Debug version of the viewer

All these files are in: `/website/whitepaper/`

### 📍 The Correct Viewer File

The working file with embedded marked.js library:
```
Location: /whitepaper 2/viewer-standalone.html
Size: 224,407 bytes (219 KB)
```

You have two copies of this file (both identical):
- `/whitepaper 2/viewer-standalone.html` ✓
- `/website/whitepaper/viewer-standalone.html` ✓

Both are correct. Use either one.

## 🚀 What To Do Now (Choose One Path)

### PATH A: Quick Fix (If You Want to Try the Most Likely Solution)

**Most likely cause:** File was uploaded in TEXT mode instead of BINARY mode, which corrupts JavaScript.

**Quick fix:**
1. Download and install [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) (free FTP client)
2. Connect to your Hostinger account via FTP
3. In FileZilla: Go to Transfer menu → Transfer type → Select **Binary**
4. Delete the old `viewer-standalone.html` from your server
5. Upload the new one from `/whitepaper 2/viewer-standalone.html`
6. Verify the file size on the server is exactly 224,407 bytes
7. Clear your browser cache (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+F5)
8. Test: Visit `http://yourdomain.com/whitepaper/viewer-standalone.html`

If it works: **Done!** ✓

If it doesn't work: Continue to PATH B

---

## 🆘 If You Get Stuck

## 📊 What Changed

**Before:** Viewer loaded marked.js from Cloudflare CDN
**After:** Viewer has marked.js embedded directly in the file (49 KB library added)

**File size increased:** 171 KB → 219 KB (due to embedded library)

**Benefit:** Works completely offline, no external dependencies

**Problem:** Large files can get corrupted if uploaded in TEXT mode instead of BINARY mode

---

## 🎯 Bottom Line

**The file on your computer is perfect.** ✓

**The problem is with the upload to Hostinger.**

**Most likely:** TEXT mode upload corrupted the JavaScript.

**Solution:** Re-upload in BINARY mode using FileZilla.

---

## Next Step

👉 **Open QUICK_FIX_CHECKLIST.md and start with Step 1**

Or if you want to try the quick fix first:

👉 **Download FileZilla, set to BINARY mode, re-upload the 219 KB file**

---

Good luck! The file works perfectly - we just need to get it onto Hostinger without corruption.
