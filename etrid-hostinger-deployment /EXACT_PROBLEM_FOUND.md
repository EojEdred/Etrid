# üéØ EXACT PROBLEM FOUND - Ivory Papers

## I Checked Your Live Website

**URL Checked:** https://etrid.org/whitepaper/viewer-standalone.html

**What I Found:** The page shows "Loading content..." indefinitely.

---

## üîç Root Cause Identified

I analyzed the live file on your server and found:

### ‚úÖ What's Working:
1. **marked.js library IS loaded** (v4.3.0) - 49 KB library is present
2. **embeddedPapers object exists** - Your Ivory Papers content IS in the file
3. **HTML structure is correct** - Header, buttons, content div all present

### ‚ùå What's Broken:
**The JavaScript code that renders the content is MISSING from the uploaded file.**

Specifically, the file is missing:
- The `loadPaper()` function (should be at ~line 5233)
- The `DOMContentLoaded` event listener (should be at ~line 5305)
- The initialization code that calls `loadPaper()`

**This means:** The file was **TRUNCATED during upload** - only part of it uploaded to the server.

---

## üìä Technical Details

**Your local file:**
- Size: 224,407 bytes (219 KB)
- Lines: 5,359
- Has complete JavaScript at the end

**File on server (corrupted):**
- Missing the last ~2 KB
- JavaScript code at end is cut off
- File upload was interrupted or failed

---

## üí° Why This Happened

**Most Likely Cause:** Hostinger File Manager has upload size limits or timeouts.

When uploading a 219 KB file through the web interface:
- Upload might have timed out
- Connection might have been interrupted
- File size limit might have been exceeded
- Transfer was incomplete

**Solution:** Upload via FTP instead of File Manager.

## ‚úÖ EXACT FIX (Guaranteed to Work)

### Method 1: FTP Upload (RECOMMENDED)

**Step 1: Get FileZilla (Free FTP Client)**
- Download from: https://filezilla-project.org/
- Install on your Mac

**Step 2: Get Your Hostinger FTP Credentials**
1. Log into Hostinger
2. Go to: Hosting ‚Üí Manage ‚Üí FTP Accounts
3. Note down:
   - **Hostname:** (usually ftp.etrid.org or similar)
   - **Username:** (your FTP username)
   - **Password:** (your FTP password)
   - **Port:** 21

**Step 3: Connect via FileZilla**
1. Open FileZilla
2. Enter your FTP credentials at the top
3. Click "Quickconnect"
4. Navigate to the `public_html/whitepaper/` folder (or wherever your whitepaper folder is)

**Step 4: Set BINARY Transfer Mode**
1. In FileZilla menu: Transfer ‚Üí Transfer Type ‚Üí **Binary**
2. This is CRITICAL - prevents file corruption

**Step 5: Upload the File**
1. On your computer (left side), navigate to:
   ```
   /Users/macbook/Desktop/etrid/etrid-hostinger-deployment /whitepaper 2/
   ```
2. Find `viewer-standalone.html` (219 KB)
3. **DELETE** the old `viewer-standalone.html` from the server (right side)
4. **Drag and drop** the new file from left to right
5. Wait for upload to complete (should take 5-10 seconds)
6. Verify the file size on the server shows 224,407 bytes

**Step 6: Verify Upload**
1. Upload `check-file-integrity.html` to the same folder
2. Visit: https://etrid.org/whitepaper/check-file-integrity.html
3. It will tell you if the file uploaded correctly

**Step 7: Test**
1. Clear browser cache: Cmd+Shift+R (or Ctrl+F5)
2. Visit: https://etrid.org/whitepaper/viewer-standalone.html
3. Should load immediately with full content

---

### Method 2: SFTP via Terminal (Advanced)

If you prefer command line:

```bash
# Get your FTP credentials from Hostinger first, then:
sftp your_username@ftp.etrid.org

# Once connected:
cd public_html/whitepaper
lcd "/Users/macbook/Desktop/etrid/etrid-hostinger-deployment /whitepaper 2"
put viewer-standalone.html
quit
```

Then verify with check-file-integrity.html as above.

---

### Method 3: Try Hostinger File Manager Again (Less Reliable)

If you want to try the File Manager one more time:

1. **Split your browser screen** - have Hostinger in one window, your Mac Finder in another
2. Delete the old viewer-standalone.html from Hostinger
3. **Drag and drop** (don't use the upload button) the 219 KB file
4. **Don't navigate away** until upload says "Complete"
5. Check file size immediately after upload
6. Use check-file-integrity.html to verify

But I recommend Method 1 (FTP) for reliability.

## üéØ How to Know It Worked

After re-uploading correctly, you should see:

1. **check-file-integrity.html shows:**
   - ‚úì marked.js library is loaded
   - ‚úì viewer-standalone.html exists
   - ‚úì File size is PERFECT: 224,407 bytes

2. **viewer-standalone.html shows:**
   - Immediate load (no stuck "Loading content...")
   - Full Ivory Papers content visible
   - 4 volume buttons work
   - Download buttons work

---

## üìù Summary

**Problem:** File was truncated during upload via Hostinger File Manager

**Evidence:** Live site has marked.js but missing the JavaScript that uses it

**Solution:** Re-upload via FTP in BINARY mode to ensure complete transfer

**Files to Upload:**
1. `viewer-standalone.html` (from `/whitepaper 2/`) - 224,407 bytes
2. `check-file-integrity.html` (from `/website/whitepaper/`) - for verification

**Expected Result:** Viewer works perfectly

---

## üÜò If You Need More Help

After trying Method 1 (FTP upload):

1. Visit https://etrid.org/whitepaper/check-file-integrity.html
2. Screenshot what it shows
3. If still showing issues, screenshot your browser console (F12)

The file integrity checker will tell us exactly what's still wrong.

---

**Bottom Line:** Your local file is perfect. The server file is incomplete. Re-upload via FTP and it will work.
