# üîß FIX: "Loading content..." Issue

## The Problem
Your Ivory Papers viewer shows "Loading content..." and never loads.

## The Solution - Follow These Steps EXACTLY

### Step 1: Upload the Debug Version

Upload this file to your server:
```
File: whitepaper/viewer-standalone-debug.html
Location on your computer: /website/whitepaper/viewer-standalone-debug.html
Upload to: yourdomain.com/whitepaper/viewer-standalone-debug.html
```

### Step 2: Visit the Debug Version

Visit: `https://yourdomain.com/whitepaper/viewer-standalone-debug.html`

### Step 3: Open Browser Console

- **Chrome/Edge:** Press F12 or Cmd+Option+J (Mac) / Ctrl+Shift+J (Windows)
- **Firefox:** Press F12 or Cmd+Option+K (Mac) / Ctrl+Shift+K (Windows)
- **Safari:** Press Cmd+Option+C

### Step 4: Look for Debug Messages

You'll see messages like:
```
üîç DEBUG: Script executing, marked = undefined
```

**If you see "marked = undefined":**
- ‚ùå The file you uploaded does NOT have the embedded marked.js
- ‚ùå You uploaded the WRONG file
- ‚ùå OR the file got corrupted during upload

**If you see "marked = function":**
- ‚úÖ The file IS correct
- ‚úÖ But there's a different issue (rare)

## Most Likely Cause: Wrong File Uploaded

### Check File Size on Server

After uploading, check the file size on your server:

**Correct file size:** 224,407 bytes (exactly 219 KB)

**If it's smaller (like 175,000 bytes):**
- You uploaded the OLD version without embedded marked.js
- Delete it and upload the correct one

### How to Upload Correctly

**If using FTP client (FileZilla, Cyberduck, etc.):**
1. Make sure transfer mode is set to **BINARY** (not ASCII/TEXT)
2. Delete the old `viewer-standalone.html` on server
3. Upload the new one from: `/website/whitepaper/viewer-standalone.html`
4. Verify file size after upload: should be 224,407 bytes

**If using Hostinger File Manager:**
1. Delete old `viewer-standalone.html`
2. Click "Upload" button
3. Select the 219 KB file from your computer
4. Wait for upload to complete (don't interrupt!)
5. Check file size - right-click file ‚Üí Properties

## Alternative: Check Which File You Have

On your computer, you have these files:

```
‚úÖ viewer-standalone.html (219 KB) ‚Üê The CORRECT file with embedded marked.js
‚ùå viewer.html (smaller) ‚Üê OLD version, uses CDN
‚ùå viewer-embedded.html (smaller) ‚Üê Different version

‚úÖ viewer-standalone-debug.html (219 KB) ‚Üê Debug version of the correct file
```

**Make sure you're uploading `viewer-standalone.html` (219 KB)**

## Quick Test Files

I created these test files for you:

### 1. test-simple.html (373 bytes)
Tests if basic JavaScript works at all.

Upload and visit - if you see "SUCCESS!" then JavaScript works.

### 2. diagnostic.html (1.6 KB)
Shows detailed diagnostic information.

Upload and visit - screenshot the results and share if needed.

### 3. viewer-standalone-debug.html (219 KB)
Same as the working viewer but with console logging.

This will tell you EXACTLY what's wrong.

---

## After Uploading Correct File

1. **Clear browser cache:** Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+F5 (Windows)
2. **Try incognito/private window**
3. **Check browser console** for any errors

---

## If STILL Not Working

Upload `viewer-standalone-debug.html` and send me:

1. Screenshot of the browser console (F12)
2. Screenshot of the page
3. File size of viewer-standalone.html on your server

This will show me exactly what's wrong!

---

## Summary

**Most likely issue:** You uploaded the old 171 KB file instead of the new 219 KB file.

**Solution:** Delete and re-upload the correct 219 KB `viewer-standalone.html` in BINARY mode.

**File location on your computer:**
```
/Users/macbook/Desktop/etrid/etrid-hostinger-deployment /website/whitepaper/viewer-standalone.html
```

**File size:** Should be exactly 224,407 bytes (219 KB)
