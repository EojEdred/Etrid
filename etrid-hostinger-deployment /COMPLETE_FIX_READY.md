# ✅ IVORY PAPERS FIX - READY TO DEPLOY

## 🎯 What Was Wrong
Your ivory papers viewer at https://etrid.org/whitepaper/viewer-standalone.html was stuck on "Loading content..." because:

- The 219 KB viewer-standalone.html file was **truncated during upload** via Hostinger File Manager
- Web-based file managers can't handle files this large reliably
- The file needs to be uploaded via **FTP in BINARY mode** instead

## 🚀 AUTOMATED SOLUTION (Ready to Run!)

I created an automated Python script that uploads the file via FTP for you.

### Quick Start (2 Minutes)

```bash
cd "/Users/macbook/Desktop/etrid/etrid-hostinger-deployment "
python3 upload-ivory-papers-ftp.py
```

The script will:
1. Ask for your Hostinger FTP credentials
2. Upload viewer-standalone.html in BINARY mode
3. Verify the file size matches
4. Upload the integrity checker file
5. Tell you if it succeeded

### What You Need

**FTP Credentials from Hostinger:**
1. Log into Hostinger
2. Go to: **Hosting** → **Manage** → **FTP Accounts**
3. You'll need:
   - FTP Host (e.g., ftp.etrid.org)
   - Username
   - Password

## 📋 Manual Alternative (10 Minutes)

If you prefer to do it manually with FileZilla:

1. **Read:** `FIX_NOW.md` (step-by-step guide)
2. **Download:** FileZilla from https://filezilla-project.org/
3. **Connect** with your FTP credentials
4. **Set transfer mode** to BINARY (critical!)
5. **Upload** the file from: `/whitepaper 2/viewer-standalone.html`

## ✅ Verification Steps

After uploading:

### 1. Test File Integrity
Visit: https://etrid.org/whitepaper/check-file-integrity.html

**You should see:**
- ✓ marked.js library is loaded
- ✓ viewer-standalone.html exists
- ✓ File size is PERFECT: 224,407 bytes

### 2. Test the Viewer
Visit: https://etrid.org/whitepaper/viewer-standalone.html

**Clear cache first:** Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+F5 (Windows)

**You should see:**
- ✅ ËTRID IVORY PAPERS header
- ✅ 4 volume buttons (Complete Edition, Vol I, Vol II, Vol III)
- ✅ Content loads immediately (no "Loading content..." stuck)
- ✅ Buttons switch between volumes
- ✅ Download buttons work

### 3. Browser Console Check
If anything looks wrong:
- Press F12 to open developer tools
- Click "Console" tab
- Look for any red error messages
- All should be clean (no errors)

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Script says "Connection refused"
- Check your FTP host is correct (try with and without "ftp." prefix)
- Verify port 21 is accessible
- Some networks block FTP - try on a different network

### Script says "Permission denied"
- Double-check your FTP username and password
- Make sure the FTP account has write permissions
- Try logging into Hostinger and resetting the FTP password

### File uploads but viewer still stuck
- Clear ALL browser data (not just cache)
- Try in incognito/private window
- Try a completely different browser
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors

### Can't find FTP credentials
- In Hostinger: Hosting → Advanced → FTP Accounts
- Or create a new FTP account in Hostinger
- Contact Hostinger support: "I need my FTP credentials for etrid.org"

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check the Python script output** - it will tell you what went wrong
2. **Try the manual method** (FIX_NOW.md) - more reliable if network has restrictions
3. **Contact Hostinger support** - they can check server-side issues
4. **Check browser console** - shows JavaScript errors if any

## 📝 Notes

- The automated script uses Python's built-in ftplib (no extra dependencies needed)
- File is uploaded in BINARY mode (critical for preventing corruption)
- Script verifies file size after upload
- Both the viewer and integrity checker are uploaded
- Your FTP password is hidden when you type it (getpass)
