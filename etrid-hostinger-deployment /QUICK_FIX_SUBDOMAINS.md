# ⚡ QUICK FIX: Explorer, Bridge, Faucet Not Found

## 🔴 THE PROBLEM

You're seeing **"having trouble finding site"** because these subdomains **don't exist yet** on Hostinger.

The files are ready - you just need to **create the subdomains first**!

---

## ✅ THE SOLUTION (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Create Subdomains in Hostinger

Go to Hostinger Control Panel → **Domains** → **Subdomains**

Create these 3 subdomains:
```
1. explorer
2. bridge
3. faucet
```

### Step 2: Upload Files

For each subdomain, upload the zip file:

| Subdomain | Upload This File |
|-----------|------------------|
| explorer.etrid.org | `apps/explorer-deploy.zip` |
| bridge.etrid.org | `apps/bridge-deploy.zip` |
| faucet.etrid.org | `apps/faucet-deploy.zip` |

### Step 3: Extract Files

In File Manager:
1. Navigate to the subdomain folder
2. Extract the zip file
3. Delete the zip after extraction

## 📍 VERIFIED FILE CONTENTS

All 3 packages are **correct and ready**:

✅ **explorer-deploy.zip** (2.9 KB)
- index.html (10.8 KB) ✓
- .htaccess (123 bytes) ✓

✅ **bridge-deploy.zip** (2.6 KB)
- index.html (10.5 KB) ✓
- .htaccess (123 bytes) ✓

✅ **faucet-deploy.zip** (2.6 KB)
- index.html (8.9 KB) ✓
- .htaccess (123 bytes) ✓

---

## ⏱️ TIMELINE

1. Create subdomain: **2 minutes**
2. DNS propagation: **5-10 minutes**
3. Upload & extract files: **2 minutes**
4. **Total: ~15 minutes per subdomain**

---

## 🎯 WHAT HAPPENS NEXT

After creating the subdomains and uploading:

✅ **explorer.etrid.org** → Will show block explorer interface
✅ **bridge.etrid.org** → Will show cross-chain bridge UI
✅ **faucet.etrid.org** → Will show testnet faucet page

---

## 🚨 COMMON MISTAKE

❌ **DON'T** try to access the URLs before creating the subdomains
✅ **DO** create subdomains first, then upload files, then test

---

## 📞 STILL HAVING ISSUES?

If subdomains still don't work after 15-20 minutes:

1. Check you created the subdomain correctly (spelled exactly: `explorer`, `bridge`, `faucet`)
2. Verify files are in the subdomain root directory (not in a nested folder)
3. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+F5)
4. Try accessing from incognito/private window
5. Check Hostinger DNS settings are correct

---

**The files are good! Just need to create the subdomains on Hostinger first.** 🚀
