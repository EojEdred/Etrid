python3 upload-ivory-papers-ftp.py

# 2. Upload Network Monitoring page
python3 upload-monitoring-page.py
```

## 📋 What You'll Need

**FTP Credentials** (same for both scripts):
1. Log into Hostinger
2. Go to: **Hosting → Manage → FTP Accounts**
3. Get:
   - FTP Host (e.g., ftp.etrid.org)
   - Username
   - Password

Both scripts will ask for these credentials when you run them.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Both Scripts: "Connection refused"
- Check FTP host is correct
- Try without "ftp." prefix (just "etrid.org")
- Verify port 21 is accessible
- Some networks block FTP - try different network

### Both Scripts: "Permission denied"
- Double-check username/password
- Reset FTP password in Hostinger
- Verify FTP account has write permissions

### Ivory Papers: Still shows "Loading content..."
- Clear ALL browser data (not just cache)
- Try incognito/private window
- Run check-file-integrity.html
- Check browser console (F12) for errors

### Network Monitoring: Dashboard won't load
- Check Grafana server is running: http://98.71.91.84
- Verify server firewall allows port 80
- Check browser console for CORS errors
- Try accessing Grafana directly first

### Homepage: Navigation doesn't update
- Clear browser cache completely
- Check `index.html` uploaded to correct location
- Should be at `public_html/index.html` (not in subfolder)
