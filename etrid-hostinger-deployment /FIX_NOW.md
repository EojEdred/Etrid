# ‚ö° FIX IT NOW - 10 Minutes

I checked your live website at https://etrid.org/whitepaper/viewer-standalone.html

**The problem:** Your file was **truncated during upload**. Only part of it uploaded to the server.

**The fix:** Re-upload via FTP. Takes 10 minutes.

---

## üéØ DO THIS NOW (Step by Step)

### 1. Download FileZilla (2 minutes)

Go to: https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client

Click: **Download FileZilla Client** (it's free)

Install it on your Mac.

---

### 2. Get Your FTP Credentials (1 minute)

1. Log into your Hostinger account
2. Go to: **Hosting** ‚Üí **Manage** ‚Üí **FTP Accounts**
3. You'll see your FTP details:
   - **Host/Server:** (something like ftp.etrid.org)
   - **Username:** (your FTP username)
   - **Password:** (click "Show" or reset if needed)
   - **Port:** 21

Write these down or keep the page open.

---

### 3. Connect to Your Server (1 minute)

1. Open FileZilla
2. At the top, fill in these fields:
   - **Host:** (your FTP server from step 2)
   - **Username:** (from step 2)
   - **Password:** (from step 2)
   - **Port:** 21
3. Click: **Quickconnect**

You'll see your server files appear on the right side.

---

### 4. Navigate to Whitepaper Folder (1 minute)

**On the right side (server):**
- Look for folders like: `public_html` or `www` or `httpdocs`
- Click into that folder
- Find and click into the `whitepaper` folder
- You should see your current `viewer-standalone.html` file

**On the left side (your computer):**
- Navigate to: `/Users/macbook/Desktop/etrid/etrid-hostinger-deployment /whitepaper 2/`
- You should see the 219 KB `viewer-standalone.html` file

---

### 5. Set Transfer Mode to BINARY (30 seconds)

**In FileZilla menu bar:**
- Click: **Transfer** ‚Üí **Transfer Type** ‚Üí **Binary**

This is CRITICAL. If you skip this, the file will get corrupted again.

---

### 6. Upload the File (1 minute)

1. **On the right side (server):** Right-click the old `viewer-standalone.html` ‚Üí **Delete**
2. **On the left side (your computer):** Find `viewer-standalone.html` (219 KB)
3. **Drag it from left to right** (from your computer to the server)
4. **Wait** for the upload to complete (FileZilla will show a green checkmark)
5. **Verify** the file size on the server shows `224,407` bytes

---

### 7. Upload the Checker File (1 minute)

**On the left side:**
- Navigate to: `/Users/macbook/Desktop/etrid/etrid-hostinger-deployment /website/whitepaper/`
- Find: `check-file-integrity.html`

**Drag it to the right side** (into the same whitepaper folder)

---

### 8. Verify Upload Was Successful (1 minute)

1. Open your browser
2. Go to: **https://etrid.org/whitepaper/check-file-integrity.html**
3. You should see:
   - ‚úì Step 1/3: marked.js library is loaded
   - ‚úì Step 2/3: viewer-standalone.html exists
   - ‚úì Step 3/3: File size is PERFECT: 224,407 bytes

If you see all green checkmarks, continue to step 9.

If you see red X marks, take a screenshot and check your FTP transfer mode.

---

### 9. Clear Your Browser Cache (30 seconds)

**Mac:**
- Press: `Cmd + Shift + R`

**Windows:**
- Press: `Ctrl + F5`

Or open an **incognito/private window** (Cmd+Shift+N)

---

### 10. Test the Viewer (30 seconds)

Visit: **https://etrid.org/whitepaper/viewer-standalone.html**

**You should now see:**
- ‚úÖ √ãTRID IVORY PAPERS header
- ‚úÖ 4 volume buttons
- ‚úÖ Complete Edition content displayed
- ‚úÖ Can click buttons to switch volumes
- ‚úÖ Download buttons work

**If it works: DONE!** ‚úì

**If it still shows "Loading content...":**
- Press F12 to open console
- Look for red error messages
- Take a screenshot and let me know what error shows

## üìä What Was Wrong

I checked your live site and found:

- ‚úÖ Your local file is **perfect** (224,407 bytes with all code)
- ‚ùå Your server file is **truncated** (missing JavaScript at the end)
- ‚ùå Hostinger File Manager **cut off the file** during upload

**Why it happened:** Web-based file managers can fail on larger files (219 KB is considered large for some web uploads). They time out or get interrupted.

**Why FTP works:** FTP is designed for reliable file transfers. It handles large files correctly and verifies the complete upload.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Total Time

**10 minutes** if you follow the steps exactly.

Most of that is downloading FileZilla and getting FTP credentials. The actual upload takes 1 minute.

## üÜò If You Get Stuck

**Can't find FTP credentials?**
- In Hostinger, try: Hosting ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí FTP Accounts
- Or contact Hostinger support: "I need my FTP credentials"

**FileZilla won't connect?**
- Check you're using Port 21
- Try hostname without "ftp." prefix (just: etrid.org)
- Make sure you're using the FTP username, not your Hostinger account email

**File still doesn't work after upload?**
- Visit: https://etrid.org/whitepaper/check-file-integrity.html
- If it shows file size is correct but viewer still broken:
  - Press F12 in browser
  - Screenshot the console errors
  - There might be a different issue

**check-file-integrity.html shows file is correct but viewer still stuck?**
- This is rare, but possible
- Clear all browser data (not just cache)
- Try completely different browser
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
