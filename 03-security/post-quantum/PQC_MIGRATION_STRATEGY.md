# Post-Quantum Cryptography Migration Strategy

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive strategy for migrating Etrid blockchain to post-quantum cryptography (PQC) to protect against future quantum computing threats. The migration follows a phased approach over 18-24 months, ensuring backward compatibility while achieving quantum resistance.

**Timeline:** Q2 2026 - Q4 2026 (Core), Q1 2027+ (Completion)
**Current Status:** Phase 1 (PoC) - 30% Complete

## Threat Model

### Quantum Computing Threat

**Vulnerable Algorithms:**
- **RSA:** Broken by Shor's algorithm in polynomial time
- **ECDSA/Ed25519:** Discrete log broken by Shor's algorithm
- **ECDH/X25519:** Key exchange broken by Shor's algorithm

**Impact on Blockchain:**
- Transaction signatures can be forged
- Private keys can be recovered from public keys
- Encrypted communications can be decrypted
- Consensus signatures can be forged

**Timeline:**
- 2030: Large-scale quantum computers estimated
- 2035: Quantum computers may threaten current cryptography
- **Action Required:** Migrate BEFORE quantum computers are viable

**"Harvest Now, Decrypt Later" Attack:**
Adversaries can store encrypted blockchain data today and decrypt it once quantum computers are available. This is why migration is urgent.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Hybrid Signature Scheme

**Structure:**
```rust
struct HybridSignature {
    ed25519_sig: [u8; 64],      // Classical signature
    dilithium_sig: [u8; 3293],  // PQC signature
}
```

**Verification:**
1. Verify Ed25519 signature
2. Verify Dilithium signature
3. Accept if BOTH pass (AND logic)

**Security Property:**
- Secure even if one algorithm is broken
- Provides "defense in depth"

### Hybrid KEM Scheme

**Encapsulation:**
1. Generate X25519 ephemeral keypair
2. Perform X25519 ECDH → `ss_classical`
3. Encapsulate Kyber KEM → `ss_pqc`, `ciphertext`
4. Combine: `ss_final = KDF(ss_classical || ss_pqc)`
5. Return: `(ss_final, ciphertext_x25519 || ciphertext_kyber)`

**Decapsulation:**
1. Parse ciphertext into X25519 and Kyber parts
2. Perform X25519 ECDH → `ss_classical`
3. Decapsulate Kyber → `ss_pqc`
4. Combine: `ss_final = KDF(ss_classical || ss_pqc)`

**Security Property:**
- Secure if EITHER algorithm is unbroken (OR logic)
- Stronger than either alone

### Storage Migration Strategy

**Account Storage:**
```rust
// Old format
struct Account {
    public_key: [u8; 32],  // Ed25519
    ...
}

// New format (hybrid)
struct Account {
    classical_key: [u8; 32],       // Ed25519 (backward compat)
    pqc_key: Option<[u8; 1952]>,   // Dilithium3 (optional)
    ...
}

// Future format (PQC-only)
struct Account {
    pqc_key: [u8; 1952],  // Dilithium3 only
    ...
}
```

**Migration Path:**
1. Add optional `pqc_key` field
2. Populate `pqc_key` during migration
3. Accept signatures from either key
4. Eventually remove `classical_key`

### Transaction Format

**Current:**
```
Transaction = {
    from: AccountId(32 bytes),
    to: AccountId(32 bytes),
    amount: u128,
    nonce: u64,
    signature: Ed25519Signature(64 bytes),  // 64 bytes
}
Total: ~130 bytes
```

**Hybrid:**
```
Transaction = {
    from: AccountId(32 bytes),
    to: AccountId(32 bytes),
    amount: u128,
    nonce: u64,
    signature: HybridSignature {
        ed25519: 64 bytes,
        dilithium: 3293 bytes,  // 3293 bytes
    }
}
Total: ~3.4 KB (26x larger)
```

**Impact:**
- Block size increases 26x for same transaction count
- Storage requirements increase proportionally
- Network bandwidth increases 26x

**Mitigation:**
- Signature compression (research ongoing)
- Aggregate signatures (batch verification)
- Increase block size limit
- Optimize P2P gossip protocol

## Performance Analysis

### Benchmark Results (Estimated)

| Operation | Classical | Hybrid | PQC-Only | Overhead |
|-----------|-----------|--------|----------|----------|
| Key Generation | 5 μs | 55 μs | 50 μs | 10x |
| Transaction Signing | 10 μs | 130 μs | 120 μs | 12x |
| Signature Verification | 25 μs | 85 μs | 60 μs | 2.4x |
| Block Verification (1000 tx) | 25 ms | 85 ms | 60 ms | 2.4x |
| Network Handshake | 50 μs | 62 μs | 12 μs | 0.24x (faster!) |

**Observations:**
- Signing is 12x slower due to Dilithium
- Verification is only 2.4x slower (bottleneck is verification)
- KEM is actually faster than ECDH
- Block verification remains under 100ms (acceptable)

### Storage Impact

| Component | Classical | Hybrid | PQC-Only | Increase |
|-----------|-----------|--------|----------|----------|
| Public Key | 32 bytes | 1,984 bytes | 1,952 bytes | 61x |
| Signature | 64 bytes | 3,357 bytes | 3,293 bytes | 51x |
| Block (1000 tx) | 130 KB | 3.4 MB | 3.3 MB | 26x |
| Daily Storage (100K tx/day) | 13 MB | 340 MB | 330 MB | 26x |
| Annual Storage | 4.7 GB | 124 GB | 120 GB | 26x |

**Impact Assessment:**
- Storage increases by 26x
- Still manageable with modern hardware (1TB SSD can store 8+ years)
- Archival nodes may need upgraded storage

### Network Bandwidth

| Scenario | Classical | Hybrid | PQC-Only | Increase |
|----------|-----------|--------|----------|----------|
| Transaction Gossip | 130 bytes | 3.4 KB | 3.3 KB | 26x |
| Block Propagation (1000 tx) | 130 KB | 3.4 MB | 3.3 MB | 26x |
| Full Sync (1M blocks) | 130 GB | 3.4 TB | 3.3 TB | 26x |

**Mitigation:**
- Compression (signatures compress well)
- Only gossip transaction hashes, fetch full data on demand
- Optimize sync protocol (skip signature verification for old blocks)
- Consider erasure coding for bandwidth efficiency

## Security Analysis

### Threat Coverage

| Threat | Classical | Hybrid | PQC-Only |
|--------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Classical Attacks | ✅ Secure | ✅ Secure | ✅ Secure |
| Quantum Attacks (Shor) | ❌ Broken | ✅ Secure | ✅ Secure |
| Side-Channel Attacks | ✅ Resistant | ⚠️ Maturing | ⚠️ Maturing |
| Implementation Bugs | ✅ Well-tested | ⚠️ New code | ⚠️ New code |
| Cryptanalysis | ✅ Well-studied | ✅ Defense in depth | ⚠️ Less studied |

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Hybrid Mode:** Lowest risk (secure against all known threats)
