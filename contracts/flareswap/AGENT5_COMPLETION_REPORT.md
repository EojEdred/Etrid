   - Focus on MasterChef reward calculation
   - Review flash swap callbacks
   - Verify access controls

2. **Testnet Deployment**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-full.js --network goerli
   ```
   - Monitor for 48+ hours
   - Community testing phase
   - Fix any issues found

3. **Bug Bounty Program**
   - Launch on ImmuneFi
   - $10k-$100k rewards recommended
   - Clear disclosure process

### Short-term (Launch Phase)

4. **Monitoring Setup**

   - TVL and volume tracking

5. **Gradual Rollout**
   - Start with $100k TVL cap
   - Monitor for 1 week
   - Gradually increase limits
   - Full launch after validation

6. **Multi-sig Deployment**
   - Transfer ownership to multi-sig
   - 3-of-5 or 4-of-7 recommended
   - Include technical and business stakeholders

### Long-term (Post-Launch)

7. **Continuous Improvement**
   - Monthly security reviews
   - Quarterly external audits
   - Community feedback integration
   - Protocol upgrades as needed
