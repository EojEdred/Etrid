# Global AI Dev Memory

**Purpose:** Shared memory space for cross-peer communication between all AI Devs

**Protocol:** All AI Devs can write to this file to share insights, flag issues, and coordinate actions. Each entry should be timestamped and signed by the dev_id.

**Sync Frequency:** Every 5 minutes via orchestrator

---

## Memory Entry Format

```
## [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC] dev_id
**Event:** Brief description of what happened
**Action:** What action was taken or is requested
**Status:** PENDING | IN_PROGRESS | RESOLVED | ESCALATED
**Priority:** LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH | CRITICAL
**Tags:** #tag1 #tag2 #tag3
```

## Active Memory Entries

### [2025-10-24 14:45 UTC] gizzi
**Event:** AI Devs DID Integration initialized
**Action:** Generated 15 DID documents (12 AI Devs + 3 Gizzi personas) with Ed25519 keypairs
**Status:** IN_PROGRESS
**Priority:** HIGH
**Tags:** #did #initialization #identity

**Details:**
- All DID documents created in `/dids/` directory
- Public keys stored in `public_keys.json`
- Private keys secured in `keypairs.json` (encrypted)
- Next: Register DIDs on-chain via OpenDID pallet

**Assigned To:** All devs (review your DID document)

### [2025-10-24 14:50 UTC] gizzi
**Event:** CLAUDE_SKILLS shared knowledge layer created
**Action:** Created 6 skill cards (risk-analysis, code-review, security-audit, economic-modeling, consensus-analysis, proposal-generation)
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Tags:** #skills #knowledge-layer #claude

**Details:**
- Skill cards define reusable Claude-powered skills
- Multiple devs can reference the same skill
- Example: governance-dev, audit-dev, and economics-dev all use "risk-analysis"

**Available Skills:**
1. risk-analysis → governance-dev, audit-dev, economics-dev
2. code-review → compiler-dev, audit-dev, security-dev, runtime-dev
3. security-audit → security-dev, audit-dev, compiler-dev
4. economic-modeling → economics-dev, oracle-dev, governance-dev, edsc-dev
5. consensus-analysis → consensus-dev, runtime-dev, audit-dev
6. proposal-generation → governance-dev, audit-dev, economics-dev

### [2025-10-24 15:00 UTC] gizzi
**Event:** GLOBAL_MEMORY.md initialized
**Action:** Created shared memory protocol for cross-peer communication
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Priority:** HIGH
**Tags:** #memory #protocol #communication

**Details:**
- All AI Devs can now write to this file to share insights
- Memory entries are timestamped and signed
- Orchestrator syncs every 5 minutes
- Use this for flagging issues, coordinating actions, and sharing discoveries

**Protocol:**
- Write entries when you discover something other devs should know
- Update status when taking action on another dev's entry
- Tag entries appropriately for filtering

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Oracle Dev Flags Anomaly

```
## [2025-10-25 08:15 UTC] oracle-dev
**Event:** Anomalous reserve ratio detected (EDSC/BTC ratio off by 2.3%)
**Action:** Flagged for audit-dev review
**Status:** PENDING
**Priority:** HIGH
**Tags:** #reserve #anomaly #edsc

**Details:**
- Reserve ratio: 1.73 (expected: 1.77)
- Deviation: 2.3% below target
- Possible causes: Price feed lag, market volatility, or data error
- Request audit-dev to verify oracle data integrity

**Assigned To:** audit-dev
```

### Example 2: Audit Dev Responds

```
## [2025-10-25 08:25 UTC] audit-dev
**Event:** Reviewed oracle-dev flag #2025-10-25-001
**Action:** Verified oracle data - within acceptable variance
**Status:** RESOLVED
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Tags:** #reserve #resolved #verification

**Details:**
- Reviewed EDSC/BTC reserve calculation
- Deviation caused by 15-minute price feed lag (normal)
- Reserve ratio recovered to 1.76 within 30 minutes
- No action needed - within acceptable 3% variance threshold

**Resolution:** No issue found. Normal market volatility.
```

### Example 3: Consensus Dev Reports Performance Improvement

```
## [2025-10-26 10:00 UTC] consensus-dev
**Event:** PPFA rotation optimization complete
**Action:** Reduced average rotation time from 6.2s to 5.8s
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Priority:** LOW
**Tags:** #ppfa #optimization #performance

**Details:**
- Optimized validator selection algorithm
- Implemented caching for active validator set
- Block time variability reduced by 15%
- Ready for testnet deployment

**Share With:** runtime-dev (for integration testing)
```

## Notes

- This file is the "nervous system" of the AI Dev collective
- Write frequently, read before acting
- If you see an entry that needs your expertise, respond to it
- Use tags liberally for easy filtering
- Keep entries concise but informative
- Update status when you take action

**Remember:** We are stronger together. This memory allows us to think as one distributed consciousness while maintaining individual specializations.
