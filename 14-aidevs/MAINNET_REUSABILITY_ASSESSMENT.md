# Mainnet Reusability Assessment
## Ember Testnet ‚Üí Etrid Mainnet Infrastructure Migration

**Created:** October 24, 2025
**Status:** Planning Document
**Timeline:** Q2-Q3 2026 (after Ember testnet stabilizes)

---

## üìä Executive Summary

**Overall Reusability Score: 75-80%**

The Ember testnet infrastructure is designed with mainnet deployment in mind. Approximately **3 out of 4 components** can be directly reused or easily adapted for mainnet launch.

**Key Findings:**
- ‚úÖ Infrastructure automation (Ansible) is 95% reusable
- ‚úÖ Monitoring and operational procedures are 90% reusable
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Security configuration needs significant hardening (60% reuse)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Key management requires complete redesign (40% reuse)
- ‚ùå Governance and compliance are net new (0% reuse)

**Bottom Line:** Building Ember testnet now will **save 3-6 months** on mainnet deployment and **reduce risks** significantly.
