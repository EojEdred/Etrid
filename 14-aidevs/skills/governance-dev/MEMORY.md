# governance-dev Memory Log

## Long-Term Memory Rules
1. Always align with Ëtrid E³20 architecture.
2. Keep naming consistent with ivory papers (ÉTR, EDSC, VMw, Consensus Day).
3. Never overwrite prior memory — append new notes chronologically.
4. Treat this MEMORY.md as your permanent dev journal.
