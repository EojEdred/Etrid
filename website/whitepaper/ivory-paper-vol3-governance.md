## 1. CONSENSUS DAY - THE CONSTITUTIONAL EVENT

### Overview

**Consensus Day** occurs annually on **December 1st** at **00:00 UTC**. It is the network's constitutional moment where all major governance decisions are made collectively.

**Duration**: 22 hours total
**Frequency**: Once per year (365 days)
**Participation**: All ÉTR holders + Validators

### The Four Phases

```
Phase 1: Registration    →  6 hours  (00:00 - 06:00 UTC)
Phase 2: Voting         → 12 hours  (06:00 - 18:00 UTC)
Phase 3: Minting        →  3 hours  (18:00 - 21:00 UTC)
Phase 4: Distribution   →  1 hour   (21:00 - 22:00 UTC)
Total:                   = 22 hours
```

### Phase 1: Registration (6 hours)

**Purpose**: Submit proposals, lock stakes, register participation

**Actions**:
- **Proposal Submission**: Anyone with ≥ 10,000 ÉTR can submit proposals
- **Stake Locking**: Participants lock ÉTR to receive voting power
- **Validator Registration**: Validators signal participation (required for quorum)
- **Delegate Assignment**: Token holders can delegate votes to trusted parties

**Proposal Types**:
1. **Inflation Rate Adjustment** (hard cap: 0-5% annual)
2. **Parameter Changes** (block times, finality thresholds, fee structure)
3. **Budget Allocation** (grants, development, marketing, operations)
4. **Protocol Upgrades** (runtime changes, pallet additions)
5. **Director Elections** (elect 9 Decentralized Directors)
6. **Emergency Actions** (slash validators, pause chains, deploy hotfixes)

**Proposal Requirements**:
```rust
struct Proposal {
    proposer: AccountId,
    title: String,              // Max 100 chars
    description: String,        // Max 2000 chars
    category: ProposalCategory,
    budget_request: Balance,    // If funding required
    implementation_plan: Hash,  // IPFS hash to detailed plan
    bond: Balance,              // 10,000 ÉTR minimum
    supporting_validators: Vec<AccountId>, // Min 3 validators
}
```

**Proposal Bond**:
- **Amount**: 10,000 ÉTR (locked during voting)
- **Refund**: Full refund if proposal reaches 5% quorum
- **Slash**: 50% slashed if spam/malicious, 50% returned if simply unpopular

### Phase 2: Voting (12 hours)

**Purpose**: Community + validators vote on all proposals

**Voting Power Calculation**:
```rust
fn calculate_voting_power(
    staked_amount: Balance,
    stake_duration: BlockNumber, // How long stake has been locked
    participation_history: u32,  // Previous Consensus Days attended
) -> VotingPower {
    let base_power = staked_amount;

    // Stake duration bonus (max +20%)
    let duration_multiplier = 1.0 + (stake_duration / BLOCKS_PER_YEAR).min(0.2);

    // Participation history bonus (max +10%)
    let history_multiplier = 1.0 + (participation_history as f64 * 0.02).min(0.1);

    let adjusted_power = base_power * duration_multiplier * history_multiplier;

    VotingPower::new(adjusted_power as u128)
}
```

**Voting Mechanism**:
- **Vote Options**: Yes / No / Abstain
- **Vote Weight**: Proportional to voting power
- **Vote Privacy**: Votes are public (on-chain transparency)
- **Vote Changes**: Can change vote until Phase 2 ends
- **Delegation**: Votes can be delegated (revocable at any time)

**Quorum Requirements**:

Dual quorum system ensures both community and validators participate:

```rust
struct QuorumRequirements {
    community_quorum: Percent,    // 33% of circulating ÉTR must vote
    validator_quorum: Percent,    // 51% of active validators must vote
}

fn check_quorum(proposal: &Proposal) -> bool {
    let community_participation = proposal.total_votes / circulating_supply();
    let validator_participation = proposal.validator_votes.len() / active_validators();

    community_participation >= 0.33 && validator_participation >= 0.51
}
```

**Approval Threshold**:
- **Simple Majority**: >50% for budget allocations, parameter tweaks
- **Supermajority**: >66% for protocol upgrades, emergency actions
- **Unanimous Director Approval**: All 9 Directors for constitutional changes

### Phase 3: Minting (3 hours)

**Purpose**: Execute approved budgets by minting new ÉTR

**Minting Logic**:
```rust
fn execute_approved_budgets(approved_proposals: Vec<Proposal>) -> Balance {
    let mut total_mint_amount = 0u128;

    for proposal in approved_proposals {
        if proposal.category == ProposalCategory::BudgetAllocation {
            // Verify budget doesn't exceed annual cap
            let annual_cap = circulating_supply() * approved_inflation_rate / 100;

            if total_mint_amount + proposal.budget_request <= annual_cap {
                // Mint tokens
                mint_to_treasury(proposal.budget_request);
                total_mint_amount += proposal.budget_request;

                // Emit event
                emit_event(Event::BudgetMinted {
                    proposal_id: proposal.id,
                    amount: proposal.budget_request,
                    recipient: Treasury::account_id(),
                });
            }
        }
    }

    total_mint_amount
}
```

**Inflation Rate Control**:
- **Community Decides**: Consensus Day votes set annual inflation
- **Hard Cap**: 0-5% per year (enforced by protocol)
- **Default**: If no vote reaches consensus, previous year's rate continues
- **Emergency Override**: Directors can propose 0% inflation in crisis

**Minting Events**:
```rust
enum MintEvent {
    BudgetMinted { proposal_id: u64, amount: Balance, recipient: AccountId },
    InflationApplied { rate: Percent, total_minted: Balance },
    TreasuryFunded { source: MintSource, amount: Balance },
}
```

### Phase 4: Distribution (1 hour)

**Purpose**: Reward all participants who voted

**Distribution Formula**:
```rust
fn calculate_participation_reward(
    voter: &Voter,
    total_participation_pool: Balance,
) -> Balance {
    // Pool = 1% of total minted during Phase 3
    let participation_pool = total_participation_pool;

    // Individual share based on voting power used
    let voter_share = voter.voting_power_used / total_voting_power_cast;

    // Bonus for voting on all proposals (completeness bonus)
    let completeness_multiplier = if voter.voted_on_all {
        1.2
    } else {
        1.0
    };

    let base_reward = participation_pool * voter_share;
    let final_reward = base_reward * completeness_multiplier;

    Balance::from(final_reward as u128)
}
```

**Distribution Components**:
1. **Participation Rewards**: 1% of minted tokens divided among voters
2. **Validator Rewards**: Validators receive 0.5% bonus for participation
3. **Proposer Rewards**: Approved proposals earn 100 ÉTR per proposal
4. **Director Stipends**: 9 Directors receive equal shares (total: 0.2% of mint)

**Distribution Example**:

If 100M ÉTR minted during Consensus Day:
```
Total Minted:            100,000,000 ÉTR
Participation Pool (1%):   1,000,000 ÉTR → Divided among voters
Validator Bonus (0.5%):      500,000 ÉTR → Divided among validators
Director Stipends (0.2%):    200,000 ÉTR → 22,222 ÉTR per Director
Proposer Rewards:            100 ÉTR × approved proposals
Remaining:               98,300,000 ÉTR → Treasury for budgets
```

---

## 3. FISCAL CYCLE & TREASURY MANAGEMENT

### Treasury Architecture

**Treasury Account**: On-chain multisig controlled by 9 Directors (6-of-9 threshold)

**Funding Sources**:
1. **Transaction Fees**: 50% of all fees → Treasury (50% burned)
2. **Consensus Day Minting**: Approved budgets minted to treasury
3. **Validator Slashing**: 50% of slashed stakes → Treasury (50% burned)
4. **Cross-Chain Fees**: 10% of bridge fees → Treasury

**Treasury Balance Formula**:
```rust
fn calculate_treasury_balance() -> Balance {
    let inflows = transaction_fees * 0.5
                + consensus_day_mint
                + slashing_proceeds * 0.5
                + bridge_fees * 0.1;

    let outflows = budget_disbursements
                 + validator_rewards
                 + director_stipends
                 + emergency_expenses;

    previous_balance + inflows - outflows
}
```

### Fiscal Year Cycle

**Fiscal Year**: December 1st → November 30th (aligned with Consensus Day)

**Budget Categories**:
1. **Development** (40% of budget): Core protocol, tools, libraries
2. **Marketing** (20% of budget): Education, outreach, partnerships
3. **Operations** (15% of budget): Infrastructure, monitoring, support
4. **Grants** (15% of budget): Community projects, research, ecosystem
5. **Emergency Reserve** (10% of budget): Held for crisis response

**Budget Approval Process**:
1. **Consensus Day**: Community votes on budget allocation per category
2. **Director Oversight**: Directors approve individual disbursements
3. **Quarterly Review**: Directors publish spending reports every 3 months
4. **Annual Audit**: Third-party audit published before next Consensus Day

### Treasury Transparency

**All treasury actions emit events**:
```rust
enum TreasuryEvent {
    Deposit { source: DepositSource, amount: Balance },
    Disbursement { category: BudgetCategory, recipient: AccountId, amount: Balance },
    DirectorVote { director: AccountId, proposal_id: u64, vote: bool },
    QuarterlyReport { quarter: u8, total_spent: Balance, category_breakdown: Vec<(BudgetCategory, Balance)> },
}
```

**Public Dashboard**:
- Real-time treasury balance
- All incoming/outgoing transactions
- Budget vs. actual spending per category
- Director voting records
- Historical trends (YoY comparison)

### Mint and Burn Dynamics

**Minting Events**:
1. **Consensus Day**: Annual minting for approved budgets
2. **Emergency Minting**: Directors can mint (7/9 vote) in crisis (max 1% of supply)

**Burning Events**:
1. **Transaction Fees**: 50% of all fees burned
2. **Validator Slashing**: 50% of slashed stakes burned
3. **Deflationary Votes**: Community can vote to burn treasury reserves

**Net Supply Formula**:
```rust
fn calculate_net_supply_change(epoch: Epoch) -> i128 {
    let minted = consensus_day_mint + emergency_mint;
    let burned = transaction_fees * 0.5 + slashing_proceeds * 0.5 + voluntary_burns;

    (minted as i128) - (burned as i128)
}
```

**Target**: Long-term supply should stabilize or decrease slowly (deflationary tendency)

---

## 4. TOKEN ECONOMICS (ÉTR, EDSC, VMw)

### ÉTR (Ëtrid Token)

**Purpose**: Governance, staking, gas fees

**Total Supply**: 1 Billion ÉTR (initial), subject to inflation/deflation

**Initial Distribution**:
```
Genesis Block:           1,000,000,000 ÉTR

Allocation:
- Public Sale (40%):       400,000,000 ÉTR
- Foundation (25%):        250,000,000 ÉTR (4-year vesting)
- Team (15%):              150,000,000 ÉTR (3-year vesting)
- Validators (10%):        100,000,000 ÉTR (incentive pool)
- Ecosystem Grants (10%):  100,000,000 ÉTR (unlocked)
```

**Inflation/Deflation**:
- **Inflation**: Voted annually (0-5% cap), minted on Consensus Day
- **Deflation**: Transaction fees + slashing continuously burned
- **Net Effect**: Tends toward slight deflation long-term

**Use Cases**:
1. **Staking**: Lock ÉTR to become validator or voter
2. **Gas Fees**: Pay for transactions (measured in VMw, priced in ÉTR)
3. **Governance**: Vote on proposals during Consensus Day
4. **Collateral**: Back EDSC stablecoin (over-collateralized)

### EDSC (Ëtrid Dollar Stablecoin)

**Purpose**: Stable unit of account for payments, contracts

**Peg**: $1.00 USD (soft peg maintained by arbitrage + liquidations)

**Collateral**: Over-collateralized by ÉTR (target: 150%)

**Minting Process**:
```rust
fn mint_edsc(collateral_amount: Balance) -> Result<Balance, Error> {
    let etr_price_usd = oracle::get_etr_price(); // From price oracle
    let collateral_value_usd = collateral_amount * etr_price_usd;

    // Require 150% collateralization
    let max_edsc_mintable = collateral_value_usd / 1.5;

    // Lock collateral
    lock_collateral(caller, collateral_amount)?;

    // Mint EDSC
    mint_stablecoin(caller, max_edsc_mintable)?;

    Ok(max_edsc_mintable)
}
```

**Liquidation Process**:
```rust
fn check_liquidation(cdp: &CollateralDebtPosition) -> bool {
    let etr_price_usd = oracle::get_etr_price();
    let collateral_value = cdp.collateral_amount * etr_price_usd;
    let debt_value = cdp.edsc_minted; // 1 EDSC = $1

    let collateralization_ratio = collateral_value / debt_value;

    // Liquidate if ratio falls below 110%
    if collateralization_ratio < 1.1 {
        liquidate_cdp(cdp);
        true
    } else {
        false
    }
}
```

**Stability Mechanisms**:
1. **Over-Collateralization**: 150% target ratio prevents undercollateralization
2. **Liquidation**: Automated liquidations at 110% ratio
3. **Interest Rates**: Dynamic interest on borrowed EDSC adjusts to maintain peg
4. **Arbitrage**: Price deviations create profitable arbitrage opportunities

### VMw (Virtual Machine Watts)

**Purpose**: Measure computational cost (gas metering)

**Definition**: 1 VMw = 1 Watt-second of CPU energy

**Pricing**:
```rust
fn calculate_gas_price() -> Balance {
    // Dynamic pricing based on block fullness
    let block_utilization = current_block_vmw / max_block_vmw; // 0.0 - 1.0

    // Base price: 1 VMw = 0.000001 ÉTR
    let base_price = 1_000_000_000_000u128; // 1e-6 ÉTR in plancks

    // Price increases exponentially with utilization
    let surge_multiplier = if block_utilization > 0.75 {
        1.0 + ((block_utilization - 0.75) * 8.0)
    } else {
        1.0
    };

    Balance::from((base_price as f64 * surge_multiplier) as u128)
}
```

**Block Limits**:
- **Max VMw per block**: 10,000,000 VMw
- **Target utilization**: 50% (5,000,000 VMw)
- **Surge pricing**: Kicks in above 75% utilization

**Example Transaction Costs**:
```
Simple Transfer:           100 VMw   ≈ 0.0001 ÉTR   ($0.001 at $10/ÉTR)
Token Swap:              5,000 VMw   ≈ 0.005 ÉTR    ($0.05)
Complex Contract:       50,000 VMw   ≈ 0.05 ÉTR     ($0.50)
Cross-Chain Bridge:    200,000 VMw   ≈ 0.2 ÉTR      ($2.00)
```

- Validator 3: [address]
```

### Voting Rules

**Vote Types**:
1. **Yes**: Support the proposal
2. **No**: Reject the proposal
3. **Abstain**: Count toward quorum but not approval

**Quadratic Voting** (Optional, for contentious issues):
```rust
fn calculate_quadratic_vote_cost(num_votes: u32) -> Balance {
    // Cost increases quadratically
    // 1 vote = 1 ÉTR, 2 votes = 4 ÉTR, 3 votes = 9 ÉTR, etc.
    let cost_per_vote = num_votes * num_votes;
    Balance::from(cost_per_vote as u128 * VOTE_COST_BASE)
}
```

**Conviction Voting** (Optional, for long-term decisions):
```rust
enum Conviction {
    None,       // 1x voting power, unlock immediately
    Locked1x,   // 1x voting power, locked 1 epoch after vote
    Locked2x,   // 2x voting power, locked 2 epochs
    Locked4x,   // 4x voting power, locked 4 epochs
    Locked8x,   // 8x voting power, locked 8 epochs
}
```

### Proposal Execution

**Automatic Execution**:
- If proposal approved with quorum → Executed in Phase 3 (Minting)
- If proposal rejected → Bond returned (if >5% quorum), proposal archived
- If proposal doesn't reach quorum → Bond slashed, proposal discarded

**Manual Execution** (for protocol upgrades):
- Directors + validators coordinate deployment
- Upgrade scheduled for specific block height
- All nodes must upgrade before deadline

## 6. REWARD DISTRIBUTION & SLASHING

### Validator Rewards

**Annual Validator Reward Pool**: ~3% of circulating supply

**Distribution**:
```rust
fn distribute_epoch_rewards(epoch: Epoch) {
    let total_pool = circulating_supply() * 0.03 / EPOCHS_PER_YEAR;

    for validator in active_validators() {
        let base_reward = total_pool * (validator.stake / total_stake);
        let adjusted_reward = base_reward * validator.performance_multiplier;

        // Pay 50% to validator, 50% to delegators
        pay_reward(validator.account, adjusted_reward * 0.5);
        pay_delegators(validator, adjusted_reward * 0.5);
    }
}
```

**Performance Multiplier**:
```rust
fn calculate_performance_multiplier(validator: &Validator) -> f64 {
    let uptime_score = validator.uptime; // 0.0 - 1.0
    let finality_score = validator.blocks_signed / validator.blocks_expected;
    let participation_score = if validator.voted_consensus_day { 1.1 } else { 1.0 };

    uptime_score * finality_score * participation_score
}
```

### Delegator Rewards

**Delegation Mechanism**:
- Token holders can delegate ÉTR to validators
- Validators charge commission (0-100%, set by validator)
- Rewards automatically distributed each epoch

**Commission Structure**:
```rust
fn distribute_delegation_rewards(validator: &Validator, total_reward: Balance) {
    let commission_rate = validator.commission; // e.g., 0.10 = 10%
    let commission_amount = total_reward * commission_rate;
    let delegator_pool = total_reward - commission_amount;

    // Pay commission to validator
    pay_reward(validator.account, commission_amount);

    // Distribute remaining to delegators proportionally
    for delegator in validator.delegators() {
        let delegator_share = delegator.stake / validator.total_delegated;
        let delegator_reward = delegator_pool * delegator_share;
        pay_reward(delegator.account, delegator_reward);
    }
}
```

### Slashing Conditions

**Offense Types**:

| Offense | Severity | Slash Amount | Cooldown |
|---------|----------|--------------|----------|
| Downtime (>24h) | Low | 1% per day | 7 days |
| Missed blocks (>10%) | Low | 0.5% | 3 days |
| Equivocation (double-sign) | High | 10% | 30 days |
| Invalid finality vote | High | 5% | 14 days |
| Censorship (provable) | Medium | 5% | 14 days |
| Coordinated attack | Critical | 50% + removal | Permanent ban |

**Slashing Execution**:
```rust
fn execute_slash(
    validator: AccountId,
    offense: OffenseType,
    evidence: Vec<u8>,
) -> Result<(), Error> {
    // Verify evidence
    verify_offense_evidence(offense, evidence)?;

    // Calculate slash amount
    let slash_amount = match offense {
        OffenseType::Downtime => validator.stake * 0.01,
        OffenseType::Equivocation => validator.stake * 0.10,
        OffenseType::MaliciousAttack => validator.stake * 0.50,
        // ... other offenses
    };

    // Execute slash
    burn_tokens(validator, slash_amount * 0.5); // 50% burned
    transfer_to_treasury(slash_amount * 0.5);   // 50% to treasury

    // Apply cooldown
    apply_validator_cooldown(validator, offense.cooldown_period);

    // Emit event
    emit_event(Event::ValidatorSlashed {
        validator,
        offense,
        amount: slash_amount,
        timestamp: current_block(),
    });

    Ok(())
}
```

### Appeal Process

**Validators can appeal slashing**:
1. Submit appeal within 72 hours (costs 1,000 ÉTR bond)
2. Directors review evidence (7/9 vote required to overturn)
3. If appeal successful: slash reversed, bond returned
4. If appeal rejected: bond added to treasury

## 7. ECONOMIC SUSTAINABILITY MODEL

### Long-Term Supply Dynamics

**Target**: Slightly deflationary long-term (~1% annual deflation)

**Inflows** (Minting):
- Consensus Day approved budgets: 0-5% per year (voted)
- Emergency minting: <0.1% per year (rare)

**Outflows** (Burning):
- Transaction fees: ~50% of fees (continuous)
- Slashing: ~50% of slashed stakes (episodic)
- Voluntary burns: Community-voted (rare)

**Net Supply Projection**:
```
Year 1:  1.00B ÉTR (genesis)
Year 2:  1.02B ÉTR (+2% voted inflation - 1% burned = +1% net)
Year 3:  1.03B ÉTR (+2% inflation - 1.5% burned = +0.5% net)
Year 5:  1.04B ÉTR (+1.5% inflation - 2% burned = -0.5% net)
Year 10: 1.00B ÉTR (back to genesis, deflationary equilibrium)
```

### Fee Market Dynamics

**Transaction Fee Formula**:
```rust
fn calculate_transaction_fee(vmw_cost: u64, priority: Priority) -> Balance {
    let base_fee = vmw_cost * get_current_vmw_price(); // Dynamic pricing

    let priority_multiplier = match priority {
        Priority::Low => 0.8,
        Priority::Normal => 1.0,
        Priority::High => 1.5,
        Priority::Urgent => 3.0,
    };

    base_fee * priority_multiplier
}
```

**Fee Allocation**:
- 50% burned (deflationary pressure)
- 40% to validators (reward for block production)
- 10% to treasury (public goods funding)

### Economic Security

**Attack Cost Analysis**:

To attack Ëtrid, an adversary must:
1. Acquire >33% of staked ÉTR (to disrupt finality)
2. Operate attack for multiple epochs before detection
3. Survive slashing and social coordination against them

**Cost**:
```
Assume 40% of supply staked (400M ÉTR)
33% of staked = 132M ÉTR
At $10/ÉTR = $1.32 Billion capital requirement

Cost of attack:
- Capital cost: $1.32B
- Slashing risk: 50% = $660M loss if caught
- Opportunity cost: 8% APY = $105M/year forgone rewards
- Reputation cost: ÉTR price crash → total loss

Total cost: >$2 Billion for 51% attack
```

**Conclusion**: Economic security increases with network value and participation

## 8. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES & CRISIS RESPONSE

### Emergency Powers

**Directors Emergency Authority** (7-of-9 vote):
1. **Pause Chains**: Temporarily halt block production (max 72 hours)
2. **Emergency Upgrade**: Deploy hotfix without Consensus Day vote
3. **Slash Malicious Actors**: Immediate slashing for provable attacks
4. **Emergency Mint**: Mint up to 1% of supply for critical bug bounty

### Crisis Response Protocol

**Level 1: Minor Issue** (e.g., validator downtime spike)
- Response Team: On-call validators
- Action: Monitor, alert community
- Timeline: 24-hour resolution

**Level 2: Moderate Issue** (e.g., smart contract exploit)
- Response Team: Directors + Security Team
- Action: Pause affected pallets, deploy patch
- Timeline: 48-hour resolution

**Level 3: Critical Issue** (e.g., consensus failure)
- Response Team: All Directors + Core Developers + Community
- Action: Emergency governance vote, possible chain halt
- Timeline: Immediate action, 7-day resolution

### Social Recovery

**If network becomes compromised beyond repair**:
1. **Snapshot**: Take state snapshot at last known good block
2. **Fork**: Create new chain from snapshot
3. **Migrate**: Community coordinates migration to new chain
4. **Deprecate**: Old chain deprecated, new chain becomes canonical

**GPLv3 Protection**: Anyone can fork and continue the network

---

## 9. CONCLUSION: GOVERNANCE AS A LIVING SYSTEM

### Why This Model Works

1. **Alignment**: Token holders, validators, and users all benefit from network success
2. **Adaptation**: Annual Consensus Day forces regular evolution
3. **Transparency**: All decisions on-chain, all treasury actions public
4. **Resilience**: No single point of failure, multiple layers of accountability
5. **Sustainability**: Self-funding via fees, deflationary tendency prevents inflation

### Comparison to Other Models

| Feature | Ëtrid | Bitcoin | Ethereum | Polkadot |
|---------|-------|---------|----------|----------|
| **Governance** | On-chain annual vote | Off-chain (BIPs) | Off-chain (EIPs) | On-chain (referenda) |
| **Treasury** | Autonomous | None | Foundation-controlled | Autonomous |
| **Inflation** | Voted (0-5%) | Fixed (halving) | Fixed (~1%) | Fixed (~10%) |
| **Participation** | >33% quorum | N/A | ~5% typical | ~10% typical |
| **Emergency Powers** | Directors (7/9) | None | Foundation | Council |

### The Path to Sovereignty

Ëtrid governance is designed to achieve **true decentralization** through:
- **Economic incentives** (rewards for participation)
- **Social accountability** (transparent decisions, elected directors)
- **Technical constraints** (protocol-enforced caps, slashing)
- **Regular rhythm** (annual Consensus Day prevents drift)

**The goal**: A network that governs itself, funds itself, and evolves without relying on any central authority.

## APPENDIX B: Governance Formulas

### Quorum Calculation
```rust
fn quorum_met(proposal: &Proposal) -> bool {
    let community_votes = proposal.total_votes;
    let validator_votes = proposal.validator_count;

    (community_votes >= circulating_supply() * 0.33) &&
    (validator_votes >= active_validator_count() * 0.51)
}
```

### Approval Calculation
```rust
fn proposal_approved(proposal: &Proposal) -> bool {
    let yes_votes = proposal.yes_votes;
    let total_votes = proposal.yes_votes + proposal.no_votes; // Abstain doesn't count

    let threshold = match proposal.category {
        ProposalCategory::BudgetAllocation => 0.50,
        ProposalCategory::ParameterChange => 0.50,
        ProposalCategory::ProtocolUpgrade => 0.66,
        ProposalCategory::EmergencyAction => 0.66,
    };

    (yes_votes as f64 / total_votes as f64) >= threshold
}
```
