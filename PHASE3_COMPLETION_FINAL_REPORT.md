## ⚠️ Identified Issues & Limitations

### SDK Version Conflicts in 6 PBC Runtimes

**Issue:** Mixed SDK versions preventing WASM builds
**Affected Runtimes:** BTC, ETH, DOGE, SOL, TRX, XLM PBC runtimes

**Error Example (btc-pbc-runtime):**
```
error[E0308]: mismatched types
  --> 09-consensus/primitives/consensus-asf/src/lib.rs:68:41
   |
68 |     let slot = Slot::from_timestamp(timestamp, slot_duration.into());
   |                -------------------- ^^^^^^^^^ expected `sp_timestamp::Timestamp`,
   |                                               found a different `sp_timestamp::Timestamp`
   |
note: two different versions of crate `sp_timestamp` are being used
  - stable2509 (expected)
  - stable2506 (found)
```

**Root Cause:**
- Some PBC runtimes still reference SDK stable2506 dependencies
- Consensus primitives (`sp-consensus-asf`) need SDK version alignment
- Terminal 1's SDK update to stable2509 didn't fully propagate to all PBC Cargo.toml files

**Impact:**
- 6/13 PBC WASM files unavailable in audit package
- FlareChain runtime build potentially affected
- Does not block audit - 7 PBC runtimes demonstrate architecture

**Recommendation for Terminal 1:**
Update the following files to use stable2509 exclusively:
```
05-multichain/partition-burst-chains/pbc-chains/btc-pbc/runtime/Cargo.toml
05-multichain/partition-burst-chains/pbc-chains/eth-pbc/runtime/Cargo.toml
05-multichain/partition-burst-chains/pbc-chains/doge-pbc/runtime/Cargo.toml
05-multichain/partition-burst-chains/pbc-chains/sol-pbc/runtime/Cargo.toml
05-multichain/partition-burst-chains/pbc-chains/trx-pbc/runtime/Cargo.toml
05-multichain/partition-burst-chains/pbc-chains/xlm-pbc/runtime/Cargo.toml
09-consensus/primitives/consensus-asf/Cargo.toml
```

**Required Changes:**
- Update all `sp-*` dependencies to use `polkadot-stable2509`
- Ensure `sp-consensus-asf` uses same SDK version as runtime
- Run `cargo update` to synchronize Cargo.lock

**Priority:** Medium (doesn't block audit, but needed for completeness)

### FlareChain Runtime Build Status

**Status:** 🔄 Still compiling at session end
**Expected Completion:** 5-15 minutes after this report
**Progress:** Runtime crate compilation in progress
**Process:** Background process 2f229c

**Action:**
- Build will complete automatically in background
- WASM file location: `target/release/wbuild/flare-chain-runtime/flare_chain_runtime.wasm`
- Can be added to audit package post-delivery

### Test Execution Incomplete

**Status:** 🔄 Test compilation running
**Expected:** 132+ tests to execute after compilation completes
**Time Estimate:** 15-25 minutes remaining for compilation + execution

**Recommendation:**
- Let tests complete in background
- Add results to audit package as follow-up
- Current package documents expected test coverage (85-90%)
